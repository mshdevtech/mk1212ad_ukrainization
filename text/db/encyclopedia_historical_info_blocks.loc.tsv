encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic_hannibal	“God has given to man no sharper spur to victory than contempt of death.” – Hannibal Barca\\n\\nHannibal is widely regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history. He was a son of Hamilcar Barca, a Carthaginian leader who had fought in the First Punic War, remaining undefeated when Carthage sued for peace. Afterwards, Hamilcar conquered Iberia to regain Carthage’s lost fortunes, exploiting the silver deposits found there to pay its war reparations to Rome and make his nation powerful again. He famously made his young son swear that he would “never be a friend to the Romans”. Following eight successful years in the region, Hamilcar was killed during battle against the Iberian tribes in 228BC.\\n\\nDespite his young age – 26 years - Hannibal assumed power in Iberia following the assassination of his brother-in-law, Hasdrubal “the Fair” – so named for his preference for diplomacy over conflict. From here, he sacked the Roman protectorate of Saguntum and began the Second Punic War. His army’s journey over the Alps has become legend; a feat of daring and endurance that took Rome entirely by surprise.\\n\\nHannibal’s efforts during the war - scoring devastating victories at Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae - ravaged the Roman state and nearly brought the Republic to its knees. It is due to Hannibal, without a doubt, that Carthage’s war effort was successful for so many years. Ultimately, however, a series of setbacks, betrayals and a lack of support at home for the lengthy war stalled the conquest of Italy, eventually leading to his defeat at the climactic Battle of Zama in 202BC.\\n\\nAfter the war, Hannibal became a successful governor of Carthage. However, political opponents soon forced him into exile, where he became military advisor to the Seleucid Empire and several other eastern Hellenistic states. Unfortunately, pressure from the Romans as they expanded into the east eventually led to Hannibal’s betrayal, and he poisoned himself to evade capture around 182BC.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_carthage	Commencing 149-148BC, the Siege of Carthage was the defining action of the Third Punic War between Rome and Carthage. With the city refusing to surrender, the Carthaginians held out for over two years. The Roman forces, led by Manius Manilius, initially suffered losses at the hands of Hasdrubal and, following Manius’ failure, Scipio Aemilianus was appointed consul and charged with taking Carthage. Under Roman law, he was technically too young for the job. His first action was to defeat Diogenes’ army holding Nepheris by blockading the harbour of Carthage, cutting off their supplies, and forcing them into the field. With Nepheris crushed, Scipio intensified the main siege. In the final assault, Tiberius Gracchus, Scipio’s military tribune and brother-in-law, was the first over the wall. After hours of bitter fighting in the streets, houses and temples, the Carthaginians surrendered. The surviving population was enslaved, and Carthage levelled. Hasdrubal himself begged for mercy. His wife, unable to face such shame, killed herself and their sons. For his service, Scipio was greatly rewarded, and during his triumph was able to add “Africanus” to his name. Unusually, Hasdrubal was displayed rather than killed, possibly because of the greater humiliation involved. Despite his bravery at Carthage, Tiberius’ military fortunes waned during the Numantine War, but his later actions as a plebeian tribune earned him the favour of the common people.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_boduognatus	Leader of the ferocious Nervii, a Celto-Germanic tribe that resided in northwest Gaul, Boduognatus led his people against Caesar’s legions in 57BC. A shrewd war-leader, Boduognatus used the advantage of his local knowledge of the terrain to spring an ambush on the Romans at the Battle of Sabis. The attack of the Nervii and their allied client tribes, the Atrebates and Viromandui, took Caesar’s forces by surprise and almost overwhelmed them. However, the 10th legion, under the command of Titus Labienus, turned the tide of battle. Boduognatus, like his warriors, refused to give ground, even in defeat, and was killed, while the strength of the Nervii was decimated. In his Commentaries, Caesar praises their heroic courage, stating that they fought almost to the last man, standing on the bodies of their fallen brothers to fight on.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_ariovistus	Ariovistus was the leader of the Germanic Suebi, or “our people”. Invited by the Arverni and Sequani to aid them in their struggle against the pro-Roman Aedui, Ariovistus led his people across the Rhine, defeating the Aedui at the Battle of Magetobriga in 63 BC. In the aftermath, in exchange for their aid, the Suebi began to settle in Sequani territory. This put considerable pressure on the surrounding tribes, sparking the mass migration of the Helvetii. Rome was equally uncomfortable with the Ariovistus taking root in Gaul, but the Senate recognised him as a ‘King and Friend of the Roman People’, reputedly at Caesar’s behest, in a move to appease him. By 58BC, with the situation worsening, the Aedui and other Gallic tribes petitioned Caesar for aid. Given an ultimatum by Caesar to cease Suebian settlement and warring in Gaul, Ariovistus challenged Caesar to stop him. Conflict was inevitable as their envoys failed to reach agreement. In the battle that followed however, Ariovistus’ tribal force was broken and he and his surviving kin fled back across the Rhine, after which he was never heard from again.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_labienus	Although his exact birth date is unknown, Titus Labienus was born into an equestrian family sometime around 100BC. Labienus had ties to Pompey, but developed a close friendship with Caesar. Following his appointment as a plebeian tribune in 63BC, he became Caesar’s legatus pro praetore in Gaul. As such, he commanded engagements throughout the Gallic Wars of 58-50BC, and took full command of the legions and magisterial duties during Caesar’s absences. A brilliant strategist and commander, it was Labienus who turned the tide of battle against the Nervii. Prior to the Battle of Agendicum in 52BC, he tricked the rebelling Gallic tribes into splitting their forces, before out manoeuvring and defeating Camelugenus’ army in a pincer movement. In the civil war that followed the Gallic campaigns, Labienus allied with Pompey against Caesar. After Pompey’s death, he remained loyal to his sons, fighting against Caesar in the battles of Ruspina, Thaspus, and Munda, where he was killed during the final rout.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic	The Second Punic War is, arguably, the most sweeping, destructive war of ancient times. It marked the end of a contest for power in the Mediterranean - the establishment of Roman hegemony over the entire Italian peninsula and deep into Iberia.\\n\\nIt was a hard fought victory for Rome, however; Hannibal Barca’s campaign in Italy, following his daring crossing of the Alps, nearly brought Rome to ruin. Catastrophic defeats at Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae shattered any faith Rome’s allies had in them, and almost imploded the Republic.\\n\\nThe brilliance of Hannibal as a strategist and tactician cannot be denied; he came closer than anyone else ever had or would to toppling Roman power, but his failure was underestimating Rome’s ability to endure. After weathering the worst of Hannibal’s assault, Rome struck back under the brilliance of Scipio and finally, on the field at Zama, Carthage’s dream came crashing to an end.\\n\\nMany accounts of the Second Punic War come from Polybius and Livy, neither of whom were alive when the events they describe took place and wrote only from Rome’s perspective. Polybius in particular, is famed for being openly critical of Carthage (he was allegedly present for the final destruction of the ancient capital), and in particular the Barcids, so his accounts are heavily biased towards Rome and can almost be considered propaganda.\\n\\nAlthough the power plays of Julius Caesar, and the formation of the Roman Empire under Octavian, were still many years away, Rome’s victory over Carthage and its confederates laid the foundations for Rome the superpower.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_caesar	Born in July 100 BC, Julius Caesar was a member of the Julii patrician clan, who claimed descent from the goddess Venus. A brilliant strategist, inspiring commander, and shrewd politician, Caesar manoeuvred himself into a position of power within the Roman Republic. With Pompey and Crassus he formed the First Triumvirate, an expedient political alliance that pitted them against their conservative opponents in the Senate. Holding a ten-year proconsulship through the machinations of this alliance, he used the time wisely to conquer Gaul and defeat the Germanic tribes of the Rhineland. Recording the success of these campaigns in his ‘Commentaries on the Gallic War’, including his invasion of Britannia and the bridging of the Rhine. Following his conquest, when ordered by the Senate to relinquish his command and return to Rome, Caesar refused. His crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC and the civil war that followed led to the end of the Republic. As dictator he made many positive reforms, but his enemies continued to circle. On the Ides of March 44 BC he was assassinated in the Senate by a group of senators led by Marcus Brutus. His adopted heir, Gaius Octavius, eventually succeeded him, in time becoming Augustus Caesar, Rome’s first emperor.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_raphia	The Battle of Raphia in 217BC was fought in the Fourth Syrian War between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. Control of Syria and its extremely useful Mediterranean coast changed hands many times in the space of a century. As Successors to, and masters of portions of, Alexander’s empire, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties could not cede control of Syria to the other party: it would have been a sign of weakness. This brought them into conflict time and time again, and, in June 217BC, the two mightiest Greek-style armies ever seen led by King Ptolemy IV Philopator, and King Antiochus III the Great, clashed at Raphia. After days of skirmishing, the battle proper began with a charge of war elephants from both sides. Antiochus drove off the Ptolemaic cavalry and pursued them, thinking the battle was won. By the time he returned to the field his own centre had broken and was in disarray. His troops fled, and the battle was lost. Ptolemy IV’s victory was not without problems. He did retain control of much of Syria but the cost weakened his position at home. His Egyptian veterans rebelled and established a separate kingdom in the southern part of Upper Egypt. The secessionists, and the rebel 35th ruling dynasty, were finally crushed in 185BC. In keeping with Egyptian tradition, the victorious Greek-dominated government destroyed any mention of the rebels that they could find.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_marc	Born in January 83BC, into the Antonia clan, Marc Antony’s mother was the cousin of Julius Caesar. Following his command of a Gallic cavalry regiment in Syria, he was appointed to Caesar’s staff in 54BC and fought in the Gallic Wars. Marc Antony was a staunch supporter of Caesar, both as an accomplished military commander and later in political office. In 50BC, Caesar arranged for him to become augur, quaestor, and a plebeian tribune in an attempt to secure his own political position. Marc Antony’s subsequent violent expulsion from the Senate was one of the justifications Caesar used for crossing the Rubicon. After Caesar’s assassination, Marc Antony allied with Octavian, Caesar’s adopted son, and Lepidus. But then this Second Triumvirate also descended into civil war, as Antony and Cleopatra struggled with Octavian for control of the Republic. Marc Antony’s defeat at the naval Battle of Actium in 31BC, and the desertion of his legions, led both he and Cleopatra to take their own lives.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_vercingetorix	Vercingetorix, which roughly translates as “great warrior king”, was a chieftain of the Gallic Arverni. Against a backdrop of increasing anti-Roman sentiment in Gaul, he led his tribe and others in rebellion against Caesar’s legions in 52BC. Although initially opposed by the Arverni noble council, who expelled him and his dependents from the capital of Gergovia, he retook the city by force and was proclaimed king. In a later attempt to cut off the Roman legions from their supplies, he conducted a scorched earth policy. Eventually out-manoeuvred by the Romans, the Gallic tribes were forced to retreat to natural strongpoints. It was Vercingetorix’s retreat to the fortified city of Alesia that proved the undoing of his grand rebellion. Trapped by Caesar, who circumvallated the entire city, Vercingetorix and his force were starved into submission. After a Gallic relief force failed to beak in, Vercingetorix surrendered. Taken in chains to Rome, he was held prisoner for five years, before being displayed and then executed at Caesar’s processional triumph in 46BC.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_curio	Gaius Scribonius Curio was the son of the Roman statesman and orator of the same name. He was a contemporary of Pompey, Caesar and Cicero, and a respected orator in his own right. He is particularly noteworthy for constructing Rome’s first amphitheatre. Elected as a tribune in 50BC, Curio became a supporter of Caesar just as Pompei demanded Caesar give up his command. Cicero was one of the last senators to try and broker peace between the two statesmen. Despite his efforts, the two did not come to terms, and Curio was forced to flee Rome and join Caesar. In return for his support, Caesar paid off Curio’s debts. This led to the belief (as stated by Tacitus) that Caesar bribed him for his oratory skill. In the Civil War, Curio was made praetor, emerging victorious against the armies of Pompei. Eventually, he was sent to Africa to quell pro-Pompey sentiment, where he was killed during the 2nd Battle of Bagradas River.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_cicero	Quintus Tullius Cicero was the younger brother of the famed statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero. He served under Caesar as a trusted legate in his Gallic campaigns, notably accompanying the Proconsul on his second expedition to Britannia. Gaining much praise and support from Caesar for his inspirational military leadership, on more than one occasion, Cicero’s command turned almost certain Roman defeats into victory. The loyalty engendered between Caesar and Cicero may go some way to explaining the pardon he received after supporting Pompei during Caesar’s civil war. An honest governor who did not take bribes, Cicero was, however, also known for his emotional impulsiveness and occasional, but worrying cruelty. The Romans of the first century BC - firm believers in their own brand of stoicism - looked down on these harsh outbursts, particularly his treatment towards captives and any who dared to disobey, as he favoured old-fashioned, brutal punishments. Ultimately, Cicero’s loyalty and skill preserved him following Caesar's victory, but his good fortune left him during the Second Triumvirate, when he found himself proscribed as an enemy of the state and was killed in 43BC.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_alesia	By 52BC, Julius Caesar had won a succession of victories in his Gallic Wars, defeating several tribes and cowing others. However, with the end of his expedient political alliance with Pompey and Crassus, Caesar’s political enemies began to circle. Refused reinforcements by Rome, he faced rebellion as the Gallic tribes united under Vercingetorix of the Arverni. As Roman citizens and merchants were put to the sword across Gaul, Caesar swiftly mobilised his legions in pursuit of Vercingetorix. Harried by Caesar’s Germanic cavalry, Vercingetorix decided to regroup at the fort of Alesia. As success in an all-out assault was unlikely, Caesar laid siege to the fort to starve out the 80,000 Gauls within, ordering the circumvallation of Alesia by 18km of ditches and high fortifications. Gallic cavalry harassed the Romans during the construction, enabling a small contingent of the defenders to escape. With the possibility of the dispatch of a relief force, Caesar ordered the contravallation of the siege; another line of fortifications 21km long to protect the besiegers. With the arrival of over 100,000 Gauls to relieve the siege, the morale of Vercingetorix’s starving host was lifted. But in the days that followed, Caesar’s embattled legions repulsed all attempts to break in or out. On the final day of battle, Caesar rode amongst his legions offering encouragement, before ordering his cavalry to charge the rear of the Gallic relief force. This bold move routed the Gauls utterly, and, as they were slaughtered in retreat, Vercingetorix and his surviving allies surrendered.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic_fabius	“To be turned from one’s course by men’s opinions, by blame, and by misrepresentation shows a man unfit to hold an office.”  – Quintus Fabius Maximus\\n\\nQuintius Fabius Maximus (280 – 203BC) was a Roman statesman and general who held the office of Consul and Prodictator several times during the Second Punic War. He is known primarily for radically changing the traditional Roman war strategy in the face of Hannibal’s crushing victories over consular armies in the field. Fabius’ knowledge of the conflict made him the ideal man for the job. According to Livy, he was present for the failed negotiations that officialised the Second Punic War. After hours of fruitless argument, Fabius gathered a fold in his toga, stating “We bring you peace and war. Take which you will”. On the Carthaginian reply that they did not care, he dropped the fold and declared “We give you war.”\\n\\nAfter the destruction of a Roman army at Trasimene (where his predecessor was killed), the second such defeat in a row, a panicked Senate elected Fabius. He immediately initiated a new strategy of refusing Hannibal open battle, instead weathering him down through attrition and small, stinging skirmishes. Although it seemed, to many Romans, that Fabius was afraid, his fresh approach almost ensnared Hannibal on more than one occasion, and it was only the Carthaginian’s cunning and guile that saved his army from destruction.\\n\\nDespite its success, unpopularity in Rome led to the policy’s eventual abandonment in favour of brute force – a move which ultimately led to the greatest single defeat in Roman history, at Cannae in 216BC. As they recovered from the defeat and attempted to deny Hannibal the strength to attack again, this time decisively, the Romans re-adopted the Fabian strategy. It remained in-place until the end of the war - Hannibal was never able to win another victory against them.\\n\\nVindicated, Fabius opposed Scipio’s desire to fight openly in Africa, but became gravely ill and died in 203BC; he saw his strategy successfully repel Hannibal from Italy, but never lived to see his nation’s ultimate victory at Zama a year later. 	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_pompey	Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, was born in September 106BC. Like his father, he was a supporter of Sulla in his civil war against Marius. Inheriting his father’s command and legions, he was victorious over the Marian forces in Africa and Scilly. Proclaimed Imperator by his legions, he was granted the title Magnus, or “the Great”.  Subsequent victories, first Hispania and then in the East, which concluded the Third Mithridatic War, won him a further two triumphs. On his return to Rome, to secure land for his veterans, Pompey entered into the First Triumvirate with Caesar and Crassus. With his political position secured he granted himself, as consul alongside Crassus, command of Hispania. The collapse of Triumvirate, and Caesar’s subsequent crossing of the Rubicon in 49BC, sparked another civil war, pitting the two great generals against each other. Defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48BC, Pompey fled to Egypt and the court of the young Ptolemy XIII, where he was betrayed and assassinated by the king’s councillors. Upon his arrival in Egypt Caesar took bloody revenge upon the assassins, indicating that he intended to pardon his old ally following his appointment as dictator.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_teutobergerwald	One of Rome’s most bitter defeats, Teutoburg was the culmination of years of rebellion and politicking among the Germanic tribes. In all, three legions, the XVII, XVIII, and XIX, under Publius Quinctilius Varus, were lost when they walked into an ambush set by Arminius, a “trusted friend” of Rome. A chieftain of the Cherusci and an advisor to Varus, Arminius had been taken as a hostage to Rome, and later schooled in Roman military tactics. On the narrow and muddy forest tracks he directed them to take, beset by storms, the legions became strung out and easy prey for the waiting German warriors. Trying to regain control and impetus, Varus did manage to rally his legions and fortify a night camp, before breaking out the next morning. The escape was costly and, after a gruelling night march, the final slaughter saw the Romans squeezed between woodland and bogs on a narrow spit of land. Varus’ senior officer, Numonius Vala, fled with the remaining cavalry, and was cut down. Varus himself committed suicide. With three legions slaughtered, Roman forts and towns east of the Rhine were overrun. The shame of this defeat meant that the three lost legion numbers were never used again.	true

A supporter of Sulla in his Civil Wars against Marius, Crassus commanded the right flank at the battle of Rome’s Colline Gate in 82BC, in which the Samnites were defeated. With war over, Crassus began accumulating his fortune though the cheap auctioning of the property of proscribed persons that was forced on Marius the Younger’s defeated supporters. It was this vast wealth that bought Crassus his place in the Triumvirate, paying off Caesar’s debts and securing their later political appointments. Sharing the consulship in 55BC with Pompey, they awarded Caesar an extension of his proconsulship in Gaul, and Syria and Hispania to themselves respectively. In an attempt to match the military victories of his political allies, Crassus launched an ill-conceived war against Parthia from Syria. Defeated at the Battle of Carrhae in 53BC, Crassus’ was put to death by his Parthian captors, allegedly by having molten gold poured down his throat.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic_scipio	“Let us make war, since evidently, you have found peace intolerable.”  – Scipio Africanus\\n\\nThe man who became known as Scipio Africanus was the son of, and named for, Publius Cornelius Scipio, who was consul of the Roman Republic during the Second Punic War. Although the elder Scipio was eventually killed in battle in 211BC in Iberia, at the hands of Hannibal Barca’s brother, Hasdrubal, at 18 it is said the young Scipio had saved his father’s life at the Battle of Ticinus by charging the enemy with what Polybius referred to as ‘reckless daring’. He survived that battle, as well as the massacres at Trebia and Cannae. Though focused on achieving ultimate Roman victory, Scipio had endured enough personal loss to desire vengeance on Carthage, and the Barcid clan particularly.\\n\\nAlthough inexperienced, Scipio had won favour in Rome through enthusiasm and passion. Following his election to proconsul, he took the fight to Iberia - in his father’s footsteps, swiftly capturing Nova Carthago and dealing a sharp blow to the Barcids. From there, he pushed further into Iberia and shattered Carthaginian power across the peninsula following Rome’s victory at the Battle of Ilipa.\\n\\nHaving destroyed Hannibal’s Iberian powerbase, Scipio took the war to Africa and to Carthaginian home soil. He destroyed their network of alliances – crucially, with the Numidian tribes who had played such an important part in Hannibal’s early victories in Italy - before facing Hannibal himself on the final battlefield of the war, at Zama. Although the battle was close, it was ultimately decisive; Scipio countered Hannibal’s tactics and caused a mass rout of the untrained local levy. Shortly after this, the Carthaginian senate once again came to terms with Rome, giving Scipio the complete victory he had long sought. Although welcomed back to Rome triumphantly, he refused all honours offered him aside from the name ‘Africanus’, which symbolised his victory in the region.\\n\\nScipio Africanus went on to oversee Rome’s victory against the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia that concluded the Syrian War, before going back into politics. Following time served in office as Censor, Scipio died in approximately 193BC, after a quiet retirement spent trying, of all things, to protect his old rival, Hannibal from Rome’s vengeance.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul	Julius Caesar’s Gallic Wars mark a turning point in history, not just the end of tribal independence in Gaul, but also the beginning of the end for the Roman Republic. Caesar’s ten-year proconsulship as governor of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul, gained through the formation of the First Triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, gave him both the military power and wealth to dominate Roman politics in the years that followed.\\n\\nOur best source for the Gallic Wars is Caesar’s own commentary, which tells the story from his initial actions against the migrating Helvetii, through his policy of dividing and conquering the Gallic tribes, to the quelling of subsequent rebellions, and finally the Siege of Alesia and surrender of Vercingetorix.\\n\\nAlongside his campaign in Gaul, Caesar fought a different battle against his naysayers and opponents in the Roman Senate. His political power stemmed from an expedient and fragile alliance with Pompey and Crassus, each using the other for their own ends.\\n\\nBoth Caesar’s Gallic campaign and his political manoeuvrings were an undertaking fraught with risk. Had his opposition to, and wars against, the Gallic and Germanic tribes failed, especially his dealings with the Arverni, Nervii, and Suebi, Rome itself could have paid the price, and the world as we know it could have been very different.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_cannae	By the summer of 216BC, Hannibal had won two major victories against Rome and occupied the town of Cannae. With Fabius Maximus’ strategy of cutting the Carthaginian supply lines and refusing open battle losing favour with the Roman Senate, it was now the lot of Lucius Paullus and Gaius Varro to secure victory. As command alternated daily between the two consuls, progress was sporadic. Overconfident, Varro chose to arrange his eight legions in a deep rather than wide deployment, matching Hannibal’s crescent formation, believing Hannibal had limited room to manoeuvre and that his greater numbers would break the Carthaginian lines. Hannibal was, in fact, using the Aufidus River to secure his left flank, while the Carthaginian cavalry there, under Hasdrubal, routed their opposing numbers. Hasdrubal then chased off the remaining Roman cavalry being harried on the right. Hannibal now ordered his centre to withdraw, inverting the crescent and luring the Romans forward. His African infantry stood and held the wings. Varro’s decision to deploy in depth was his downfall, as the Roman infantry found themselves hemmed in and enveloped in a pincer movement as they ploughed forward to keep in contact with the “retreating” crescent. Hannibal won a devastating victory against a numerically superior foe, and some accounts suggest that as many as 70,000 Romans died.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_nile	The Battle of the Nile in 47BC was a clash between the armies of Julius Caesar and Ptolemy XIII, the younger brother and husband of Cleopatra VII. Ptolemy had enraged Caesar in 48BC by executing Pompey the Great who had fled to Egypt; Pompey may have been a rival, but he was a Roman and Caesar’s son-in-law. Over the following months, relations went from bad to worse. In Alexandria Caesar tried to broker a peace between Ptolemy and Cleopatra. Ptolemy’s troops were trying to isolate the Romans, and were gaining the upper hand. When Caesar heard that reinforcements were nearby he marched away from Alexandria in the hope of uniting his forces. He was successful and turned on Ptolemy’s Egyptian army. The two armies, with roughly comparable forces, met on the banks of the Nile and, in true Roman style, Caesar launched the first attack. After fierce fighting the Egyptians broke and many of them fled, including Ptolemy. According to some accounts he drowned when his ship capsized on the Nile; regardless of the details, he was safely dead and no longer a problem. Caesar had brought Egypt within the Roman sphere of influence and gained the personal gratitude of Egypt’s newly-undisputed ruler, Cleopatra.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_zama	Following his decisive victory in Iberia, Scipio was elected consul of Rome, enabling him to attack Carthage itself and force Hannibal from Italy to defend his home soil. Assembling a mixed army of fresh volunteers and the remnants of the legions defeated at Cannae, Scipio landed in Africa in 203BC. He immediately defeated Hasdrubal Gisco at the Battle of the Great Plains with the help of the defected Numidian king, Massinissa. A desperate Carthaginian senate tried to reach a peace treaty, but the terms were considered unfavourable, a Roman fleet was soon attacked off the African coast, and the war was back on. Although many of Hannibal’s Numidian veterans remained loyal, it was the bolstering of the Roman cavalry with the same fine Numidian horsemen Hannibal had used so effectively in Italy that made the difference when he met Scipio just outside Zama Regia. This time, Hannibal had a full complement of elephants, but his army was severely depleted after so long on campaign and had to be reinforced with a large local levy, who lacked both the skill and discipline of his veterans. To make matters worse, Scipio had a plan to defeat the beasts; his cavalry blew their horns, disorientating some of the elephants and disrupting Hannibal’s left-wing, and his infantry carried out an elaborate manoeuvre, side-stepping the remaining elephants so they passed through channels in their ranks. From there, they were dealt with by fast-moving skirmishers. It was a move worthy of Hannibal himself. Scipio’s cavalry took advantage of the situation and charged into their opposite numbers, driving them from the field. As his cavalry had always out-matched the Romans, Hannibal thought they would do so again. In the ensuing melee the Carthaginian mercenaries and levy were routed, leaving Scipio’s legion facing Hannibal’s highly-experienced veterans. The resultant push of spear points proved indecisive until the victorious Roman cavalry returned, charging into the back of Hannibal’s infantry and sealing Scipio’s victory. This time, the war was over. Although Hannibal escaped, Carthage capitulated to highly unfavourable terms that prevented any further expansion and gave Rome the premise to wipe them out by the middle of the 3rd century BC.	true
