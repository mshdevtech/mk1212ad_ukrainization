encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_characters_abilities_generals	The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. You can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are three attributes that unlock different categories of general’s ability: “Warrior”, which is unlocked by high zeal; “Commander”, which become available when authority is high; “Strategist”, which is dependent on high cunning. As a general or admiral improves each of his three attributes, he will progressively unlock further abilities.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls	Basic Controls	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls_compass	The manoeuvre compass is used for fine-tuning orders on the battlefield. The three arrows within its top half can be used to direct a unit or group straight ahead, or turn left or right. The button in the centre of the lower half causes the selected unit to step backwards. Holding down this button will make them turn and walk backwards. Clicking and holding down the rank and file buttons on either side change the depth of a unit's formation by increasing or decreasing the number of rows the troops stand in.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_demolish	Buildings can be demolished if you want to construct something else in their place (or leave nothing of value to an invader if you are about to lose a region to them) by use of the demolish button that appears when you mouse over a building on the settlement panel. Settlements and ports cannot be demolished at their base levels.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wells	Poison Wells	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_declare	The declare war option is used to officially open armed hostilities with another faction, as opposed to simply marching into their territory to stake your claim. Never declare war without first considering the consequences, as an ill-prepared assault could have consequences resulting in your reduction to satrapy or client status, or worse: the annihilation of your faction. Note that when making your declaration the check box asking allies to join you is defaulted to yes. Your allies will assess the situation and may agree to declare war, but might just as easily break off your alliance, leaving you to fend for yourself.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_shield_screen	Shield Screen Formation	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_flanking_melee_double	This variant of the melee double formation arranges its ships two deep in order to smash through the enemy centre to split their formation. Heavier ships are furthest from the centre of the formation.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_crossings_attack	Attacking a River Crossing	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_access_on	When an army attempts to cross the sea, a transport ship is automatically supplied to provide passage. While these ships are similar to military vessels, they are slower, more cumbersome and are unable to withstand sustained damage. With that in mind, transport ships require the protection of your fleets if they are to transport large armies across the sea. Selecting a fleet and right-clicking on a transport provides an armed escort for the journey: any attacks on the transport will have to face the fleet first. To disembark an army or agent onto land, select its transport ship and right-click on the coast.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_resources	Resources	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_agents_authority	Authority is a measure of the strength of a character’s personality. It is the ability to get things done in their particular field, and also resist authoritarian agent actions. For agents, high authority reduces the cost of their actions; for generals, it increases their radius of influence and unlocks the "commander" set of abilities.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_army_fragments_replenish	Unit Replenishment	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_ignore	Battlefield movement speed penalties are ignored by any unit with this attribute.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_divorce	This action is the same as the one above, except that it has no financial cost and a high political cost. Carrying out this action means losing the support of more patricians than would be the case by just killing her. It also has a small negative effect on the target character’s gravitas.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_frenzy	This ability improves both attacking and charging capabilities, but reduces defensive capabilities for a short time and leaves the unit fatigued for a time afterwards.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls_balance	The Balance of Power Bar	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_parties	Depending on your chosen faction, the total number of political parties ranges from two to four. Note that only Rome and Carthage have multi-family politics – that is, their political parties are divided between two or more groups representing specific houses. The choice of which Roman or Carthaginian house to control is made on the faction selection screen immediately prior to beginning a campaign, with each dynasty having their own faction-wide effects. Other than these two cases, there is only the ruling party and one opposition party per faction. Throughout the campaign you must manage your party’s influence in relation to the others such as the Senate, court or tribal council. However, controlling the balance of political power is more challenging when influence has to be maintained between more than two parties, as is the case for Rome and Carthage. Therefore, players unfamiliar with the politics system might wish to play as another faction to begin with, for which the balance only has to be kept between the ruling party and one opposition group.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_intro_formations	Each of these formations enables the effective implementation of a tactic, instantly forming up your army or fleet to maximise its strengths or exploit a weakness in the enemy. Formations can be assigned at any point during a battle, but are best set up during the deployment phase. Units in formation will maintain their fixed shape and spacing whilst carrying out orders.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_action_points	Each turn every character has a number of action points allotted to them. Every move, from the distance they travel, to the stance they adopt, to which actions they can take, costs action points. When they have been exhausted it is not possible to do anything else with that particular character until the beginning of the next turn.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_trade	Trade between regions and other factions is vital to economic development and prosperity. A province automatically receives trade wealth based on its constituent buildings. Some regions are rich in resources, valuable trade goods with prices that vary depending on supply and demand at any given time. Factions trade both goods and resources, so trade agreements made through diplomacy enable profitable trade routes to other factions.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_mighty	Any unit with this attribute is better able to withstand a charge, knocking back the charging unit with greater damage.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_group_formations	Group Formations	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_public_order_happiness	The overall happiness of a population is influenced by a variety of different contributing factors, including tax levels, [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_castle"]]food shortages[[/url]], the presence of entertainment and religious buildings, and repression through garrison size.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_arson	Your spy inflicts considerable damage to a single building within a target settlement. Targeting gates will open them in preparation for a siege attack, whilst sabotaging a port will inflict minor attrition damage to any garrisoned fleet. The success of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s zeal and any skills, traits and household members or objects they may have.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_campaign_action_points	Action Points	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_guerrilla	Your champion’s presence reduces public order in the target province. It can also increase recruitment costs and its constituent regions more vulnerable to authoritarian agent actions. The chances of this action’s success depend on your champion’s zeal, which is in turn affected by their skills, character traits, and the presence of any household members or objects they may have.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege_panel_assault	Selecting this option enables you to launch an assault on the settlement. you will have to command your army on the battlefield and attempt to take the settlement by force.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_trade_panel	Your global economy is also managed via the trade & finance panel. It shows a summary of your projected income, maps the effect that the current tax rate is having on public order and wealth, and allows the adjustment of tax levels globally for every region under your control. It is also possible to exempt a region from taxation here, should you need a temporary fix to a public order problem. Also displayed is information about how your resources are exported to your trade partners together with the profit made from each of them. Also shown are those resources you have gained from your trade partners and those you have yet to acquire.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_offices	Cursus honorum are the offices and commissions that can be allocated to subjects in your faction when they reach a certain age or rank. They work rather like character traits or household members or objects in that they give useful effects. There is a power cost associated with cursus honorum, meaning they can be used to placate useful but potentially dangerous individuals. When all the criteria for a level of cursus honorum have been met, the secure promotion button will be enabled; click on it to bestow the office.	true

Lists of your faction's current forces and agents, provinces, known factions, as well as important event messages and events can be viewed by clicking on the buttons above the map.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_battle_siege_weapons	Siege artillery pieces, such as onagers, can be recruited in the same manner as other units. However, siege engines are constructed on-site and deployed when assaulting a settlement, taking a number of turns to complete before they can be used for an attack. Ranging from simple battering rams to hulking siege towers, they directly connect with enemy walls, but are heavy, slow moving and vulnerable to attack. As such, it’s advisable to escort them lest the enemy sally out to meet their besiegers. The following siege equipment is available, depending on the research of any pre-requisite technology:	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wells	Your spy uses cunning to poison the wells in the target province, causing damage to all units within its local garrison. This also reduces the settlement’s ability to hold out when under siege. The success of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s cunning and any skills, traits and household members or objects they may have.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_mounted_fire_parthian	Any unit with this attribute can fire all around itself, rather than just in front.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_blade	Concealed Blade	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth_income	First and foremost, the amount of income from wealth depends on the tax rate. At the normal tax rate all wealth comes from taxes. At the lower tax rate you get 20% less income than at the normal tax rate, meaning if a province produces 100 wealth, 80 of that would be income. In the same way as wealth, tax rates can also be modified by characters or technologies. This means that a tax rate of -16% could be due to low taxes (-20%) and the presence of a character with a trait that increases your tax rate by +4%.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wreck	Your spy uses zeal to damage baggage and equipment belonging to the target army, temporarily diminishing the quality level of one item for all units within it. Certain skills, character traits or household members or objects can increase the effectiveness of this action.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_steady	This ability enables units in pike phalanx to better withstand a charge against them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_spike_traps	Spike traps are sunken stakes or groups of stakes concealed by foliage. Often producing more kills when charging, the foliage collapses when stepped on causing injury or death by impalement.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_army_attack_resistance	Resistance to Occupation	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire	This ability enables your general to target a friendly unit to improve their combat skills for a short time.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaughter	There is no place for subtlety when your champion charges at the target to brutally kill them. His level of zeal, along with the cunning of the target character, will influence the success of this action. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and any household members or objects your agent may have with them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_power	Your party can gain influence by completing missions, winning victories on the battlefield, and through political machinations back home. Generals with some experience can be left to lead your armies and fleets or be granted political office, known as cursus honorum. While offices cause a gradual increase, a successful general provides a major boost to your party’s influence during wartime. Although it can be left to accumulate, influence can also be used to carry out agent actions, such as assassination, aimed at undermining the influence of another party within your faction.\\n\\nInfluence is shared out in percentages amongst the parties displayed on the faction summary tab. This correlates with the amount of support each party has from within the faction, usually from an invisible ‘patrician’ class. These individuals, such as senators, tribal elders, court nobles, vary depending on the culture of the player faction (for example, the support given to the parties of the democratic Hellenistic factions comes from their citizens, rather than a patrician class). In any case, there is always a limited number of these power-granting individuals, and they can only give support to one party at any one time. Therefore, losing or gaining their support results in a change in influence. This is important when deciding whether or not to carry out political actions, as in the short term many of them cost the support of a fixed number of patricians, subjects or citizens. Observe exactly how many support each party by mousing-over the percentages at the top of the faction summary tab. 	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_shield_screen	The shield screen is a static defensive formation ideally used when defending a position or to block city streets, helping reduce its weakness to flanking manoeuvres. Units with this ability raise their shields in a static defensive formation, increasing their defensive capabilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_wedge	Use this formation to stab through the enemy line with your forward melee ships, giving you room to manoeuvre and rake their decks with missile fire prior to boarding.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_solicit	The spy uses their authority to seek out a third party to eliminate the target. The spy’s level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character, will influence the success of this action. Authority can be increased by the presence of skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_resources	Resources are the natural elements and manufactured goods present in a region. They can be exploited to your faction’s benefit, so other factions will target your territory if they wish to obtain resources they do not currently have access to. Since each region contains different resources, some more valuable than others, so it is wise to keep an army nearby to protect them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_fleet_access_on	Transports, Embarking & Disembarking	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions	Maintaining political stability is about making sure total levels of gravitas are at comparable levels between parties. In order to help achieve or maintain this balance there are various political actions available, most of which incur a financial or political cost, or both. The political cost is always a loss of support from a few individuals in the patrician class, which in turn immediately affects your party’s share of influence. However, these actions can affect influence levels in the long term; if attempts to manipulate gravitas are successful there will be favourable changes over successive turns.\\n\\nClicking on a character’s portrait on the faction summary tab reveals the UI with which to carry out these actions, the costs of which are displayed on their respective tooltips. Not all characters can be targeted with all actions; only valid actions will be displayed for each of them. The possible actions are as follows:	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_trample	This ability improves a heavy cavalry unit's charge for an extended period of time.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege_defence	Whilst your armies protect threatened regions, your settlements have their own local garrisons to act as rudimentary defence forces. These men are stationed within a settlement and cannot leave their posts to join your armies on campaign. The types of garrison troops available depend on the buildings constructed in a particular settlement. Whilst not the most skilled soldiers, garrisons who defend against besieging forces will develop strength and experience over time. Ports have an equivalent garrison navy to protect against raids and naval blockades.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_enc_help_open	This encyclopaedia can be accessed through the dedicated button on the main menu, the button in the top left-corner of the campaign map and battlefield, through the underlined hyperlinks found in advice and on panels, through the question mark buttons in the top right-hand corner of many interface panels, and by right-clicking on any technology, unit, or building card.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_run	The movement speed button is used to instantly increase or decrease the speed of units or ships. This is useful for going somewhere in a hurry, but using it too much causes fatigue.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_rumours	Spreading rumours discredits a target character, causing him to be held in lesser regard. This action causes his gravitas to be reduced, the financial cost of which increases depending on his original gravitas level.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_phase	The deployment phase is the period of time between arriving on a battlefield and the start of the battle itself, where you can arrange your units into the formation of your choice. The enemy general will deploy his men within the opposite area. All units can be secretly arranged apart from siege engines and ships, due to their size. When complete, press the start battle button to begin fighting.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_warcry2	Affecting up to four nearby enemy units, this ability heavily reduces their morale, melee defence capabilities and movement speed. Once activated, there will be a cooling-off period before it can be used again.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_blockades	A blockade is a cordon of ships that prevents any trade going through a [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_infrastructure_ports"]]port[[/url]] whilst it is in place and any fleet moored there from escaping without fighting a battle. It can be broken by a naval attack on the blockading fleet. You can blockade a port by right-clicking on it as you would another fleet, with your own fleet selected. If there is an enemy fleet moored there, a cordon graphic will appear to indicate a blockade is under way. Otherwise, your fleet will row straight into the port and occupy it.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaughter	Slaughter	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies	Spies are subterfuge experts, recruited via the recruit agents button when a settlement is selected. They can be recruited anywhere in your empire and are invisible to the enemy until detected. Spies are vulnerable to champions and exceptionally effective against dignitaries.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_spear	This spear-shaped formation allows you to drive a hole through the enemy's line with your heaviest ships at its point, melee ships in the centre and missile support at the rear.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege	In order to gain control of a garrisoned and fortified settlement it is often necessary to lay siege. During a siege your troops surround it and can either attempt to starve the defenders into capitulation or launch a direct assault using siege equipment (both artillery and engines such as rams and towers). The besieged force may choose to sally out to meet you on the battlefield, but be aware that defeating them will not automatically result in the surrender of their settlement to you. Victory in a siege turns ownership of the province over to your faction. You then have a number of options available to you, detailed below, that have a scale of penalties attached to them. In addition, there will also be public order issues if the new owners of a region are of a different culture to that of the indigenous populace.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_spike_traps	Spike Traps	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_resistance	Following the conquest of a region there will continue to be a degree of unrest in response to the change of ruler, especially one belonging to a different culture. This is called “resistance to occupation”. It declines gradually over time, but never totally disappears, so it is wisdom to leave adequate garrisons behind and manage taxation carefully.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cavalry_counter_tactics	This ability improves a unit's combat skill capabilities when fighting against cavalry, whilst reducing its defensive capabilities for a time.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_crossings_defence	When defending a river crossing it may be best to stand back in order to stay out of range of enemy missile troops.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_growth	As your campaign progresses, growth enables surplus population to accumulate via the primary buildings in your settlements, enabling them to expand. Certain buildings will improve that rate of growth. However, the larger your settlements, the more food is consumed, so it is important to keep food producing buildings upgraded in tandem with the size of your settlement in order to avoid shortages.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_buildings	Buildings facilitate unit production, can increase income, and improve governmental control within a province. The number of slots available for building inside a settlement depends on its level - so the larger the city, the greater the number of buildings it can contain. Any chain of buildings can be constructed in these slots, although some buildings require the presence of certain resources or the research of certain technologies before they can be constructed.	true

To claim victory the defender has only to keep the attacker at bay. It is possible to turn off the battle timer in the game settings of the game menu, accessed either by pressing Esc or clicking on the game menu button from the campaign map or battlefield, or through the [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/003a_enc_ui_frontend_grand_clan.html"]]faction selection screen[[/url]].	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attrition	Attrition is the loss of men due to desertion, disease, etc. An army will generally suffer attrition when in desert or extremely cold conditions unless it is native to that part of the world. Ship crews and armies transported by sea may also suffer attrition when in deep waters.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls_speed	The game speed controls are used to adjust the speed of the battle. You can pause the game or put it into slow motion by clicking on buttons to the left or return it to normal by clicking on the central button again. The two positions further right are for double and quadruple speed respectively. Remember that you can use these controls instead of tiring your troops out by running to engage the enemy.	true

If it is on friendly territory unit replenishment will occur automatically. The closer it is to a region with fresh recruits in it, the faster the rate of replenishment will be. If no replenishment occurs it may be because the army is in an enemy province or an area of attrition.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_intro	When you selected a faction, you also chose a family or party to represent within its political system. Your faction leader is the head of that party. Many characters in your campaign contribute gravitas to your party's overall influence within your faction. The more ambitious a character is, the more useful they are likely to be to your faction. However, ambition is a double-edged sword: high ambition can lead to a bid for power through civil war, so it is important to keep an eye on such characters, they are not necessarily to be trusted. You can interact with any character involved in politics on the faction summary tab by adopting them, bribing them, marrying them to a daughter of your party, spreading reputation-damaging rumours about them, or having them assassinated.\\n\\nBy carefully managing characters of political importance and engaging in the various political actions available to you, it is possible to control the flow of power between the parties within your faction. Ultimately, balance is the key – your goal is to maintain inner stability, ensuring that no single party dominates the political arena. As a general rule, too much or too little influence held by any one party, whether ruling or not, will always equate to political imbalance, potentially causing insurrection. The choices you make during the course of your campaign affect the influence that each party possesses. This includes military and civil choices that might not seem directly political, such as which generals to appoint, which skills or ancillaries to upgrade them with, and even the order in which technologies are researched.\\n\\nThere is no single approach; political non-involvement (in other words, letting the situation unfold on its own while concentrating on civil and military matters) is not necessarily a bad thing, at least in the short term. However, in the long term, inaction will likely result in certain parties gaining or losing influence excessively without you knowing.  On the other hand, a player who is politically active will be able to maintain stability for as long as possible, increasing the amount of time before a challenge is made to their leadership. When such a challenge occurs, a rival political party will break off and appear as a new enemy faction, initiating a civil war. Players who choose not to pay attention to influence levels run the risk of this occurring when they least expect it, especially in the late game as their imperium reaches the upper tiers.\\n\\nThe civil war event is essentially the political endgame, see below for further details. 	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_mechanics	Diplomacy is the art of negotiation used to maintain relations between rival factions for as long as possible. Think of it as a useful tool for holding back the inevitable descent into hostilities. The diplomacy system enables you to construct deals with other factions to facilitate increased trade, military alliances and access through territory, peace treaties, and payments to secure an agreement, and, finally, when all else has failed, formal declarations of war. 	true

With a group selected, use the attack or defend button to select the AI’s stance, then right-click to select an enemy target or an area to defend. They can be given a set of basic instructions:<p><p>A) Attack this enemy: Click on the enemy army you want the AI-controlled group to attack.<p>B) Defend this position: AI-controlled group will defend the position it is standing on.<p><p>The AI-controlled group will carry out its instructions until completed or you give it another, conflicting order.<p><p>NB: If the AI-controlled group destroys its target it will defend its current position until given further orders.<p><p>This functionality is accessed through the user interface at the bottom of the screen.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_traditions	When a force is first mustered it is named, given a unique emblem and, from that point on, creates its own legacy through its actions in the field. This enables the development of traditions that have positive effects in the same way that skills benefit the characters that have them. Some traditions are unique to certain factions, affecting aspects of both battles and campaigns. An force's legacy and traditions forever remain with its emblem, living on long after its original troops have succumbed to their fates. When a new force is raised, you can choose to hand down the legacy of its forebears to your newest recruits.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_battle_siege_ladders	The simplest form of equipment, this is simply a long ladder that can be leaned against a settlement's walls so troops can try to climb onto the battlements and capture the towers and gates.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_sharp_stones	Sharp stone beds are created from various types of stone, constructed as a form of non-lethal defence around settlements. Stones can either sunk into the ground or layed in irregular piles. Infantry find these difficult objects to traverse, whereas cavalry can only pass through by picking routes between the stones. This slowing effect produces an effective killing zone in and around the stones, ideal ground for missile units to trap their targets.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_garrison	By moving an army into a settlement, it becomes part of the garrison. Whilst inside, its units can replenish any losses at a faster rate and, if the settlement is attacked, will have improved morale. A garrisoned army suffers attrition when under siege if occupying a landlocked settlement or a port which is both under siege and blockade.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_crossings_bridges	If there is a bridge or ford crossing a river on the campaign map, and an army is standing close to it when they are attacked, the resulting battle will occur at the crossing, so the battlefield will feature the river and at least one bridge or ford.

A faction can develop technology along three paths of specialisation, each consisting of three interlocking modules. While each technology has its own inherent benefits, researching all technologies within a module has an overall effect that is greater than the sum of its parts. To begin, simply select the item you wish to research. There are no buildings required in order to do this, although there are some buildings that require certain technologies before they can be constructed.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_undermine	Use of this action disrupts the target army, temporarily reducing its general’s authority, whilst reducing its ability to attack and defend in the field. Undermining authority has the added benefit of increasing vulnerability to further acts of subterfuge and reducing zone of control on the campaign map. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your dignitary’s own authority, which can be increased by skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_threats	A dignitary can disrupt his target army by temporarily reducing its zeal with threats that a more powerful army is poised to destroy it. This dents the morale of its general and his bodyguard, whilst also diminishing the impact of their charge and both their melee and missile attack capabilities. On the campaign map, the army as a whole becomes more vulnerable to subterfuge.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_skill_branches	As a general gains experience by leading your armies into battle, his rank and skills develop across three distinct disciplines. The “Commander” develops his influence over his troops in battle, improving his ability to inspire and rally them. The “Strategist” develops across a campaign by reducing recruitment costs, speeding-up unit replenishment, and increasing army movement extents. The “Warrior” has influence on both the battle and campaign maps, using his growing reputation to improve unit abilities and reduce the enemy’s morale on the battlefield, whilst increasing happiness throughout friendly regions and provinces. Your general can progress evenly in each discipline or choose to specialise in a single area.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_regions	Regions contain both resources and settlements in which you can construct buildings to improve their strategic and economic potential, enabling growth. Depending on settlement size and available resources, different chains of buildings will become available for development. Since not all resources are available in all regions, some regions will become targets for your rivals, so it is wise to keep a military presence nearby should a vital region be attacked.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_raphia	This formation places a main line of pikemen with heavy infantry to the left and light infantry to the right.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_weather	Weather conditions should be considered when fighting a battle. Unless they can be used to your advantage, you may wish to delay fighting until they improve. The prevailing weather is displayed prior to deployment so you can make an informed choice about fighting in certain conditions before joining battle. Wet conditions will affect the usefulness of missile weapons in single player battles. This means that fire arrows will not work (and therefore cannot be used by either side). Fatigued units also recover more slowly in wet weather or snow. It is also much more difficult to set a building or ship alight in the rain, and by the same token anything on fire will be extinguished more quickly due to the downpour. Mists and fog may occur close to ground level or the surface of water, affecting the range and accuracy of missiles. Enemy units (not ships) will be concealed if they are 600 metres away or further.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_forests	Be careful when fighting in woods or forests, cavalry will be far less effective due to the restrictions on movement provided by tree cover.

The greater the number of slaves present in a province, the higher the economic bonus given. They are a vital part of your labour force, enabling you to significantly boost your economy. However, dealing with them can be a double-edged sword, as enslaving enemy prisoners following battles, or capture of their settlements, can damage diplomatic relations with other factions of the same culture. Once captured, slaves are automatically distributed across your empire. If their numbers grow too large there may be dissent, which if left unchecked can eventually lead to a slave revolt.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_betrayal	Exploiting their duplicitous talents, your dignitary will first befriend and win the trust of a target, before revealing his deadly intent. Their cunning, along with the authority of the target character, will also influence this action’s chances of success. Cunning can be increased through the acquisition of skills, character traits, and the presence of any household members or objects.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_magnesia	Mixed blocks of pike infantry and elephants in the middle. Melee infantry and spearmen occupy the flanks along with missile infantry and cavalry. This formation was used by the Seleucid king, Antiochus the Great, at Magnesia in 190BC.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_corruption	By deploying a dignitary in a foreign province, security can be reduced, which also increases faction-wide corruption. This reduces satisfaction amongst the population and increases construction costs. Regions within the target province also become more vulnerable to further subterfuge. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your dignitary’s authority, which can be increased by skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict	The conflict phase is the period after deployment when the actual fighting of the battle occurs. At this point it is possible to select your units or ships and give them orders, either by clicking on the appropriate unit card on the battle review panel or the unit or ship itself.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_temptation	An attempt to manipulate a foreign agent through underhand trickery can work very well against an unsuspecting target.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_coordination	War co-ordination is not a diplomatic option as such, but you can initiate it from the diplomacy panel. It makes your allies increase their efforts to destroy a designated target. You don't have to talk to a specific faction to designate a war co-ordination target; when you left-click on a settlement it is marked as the target and your allies will automatically send their forces against it.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_flying_wedge_formation	Flying Wedge Formation	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_stances_balanced	Balanced stance is generally the safest one to adopt. It ensures your units do not act too aggressively or defensively, reacting to events without undue bias in their behaviour, as no special bonuses are applied whilst they are in it. Your force will attempt to retreat if things get out of control and will chase down the enemy when they retreat. However, if you win the battle but the enemy force is still intact, they will retreat away from you; it may be necessary to attack a second time to destroy them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_scare_immune	A unit with this attribute cannot be scared by any of the scare attributes mentioned above.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_patrol	Fleets can be ordered to patrol the sea region they are stationed within. This stance enables them to passively detect and reduce piracy, also improving their ability to defend themselves if attacked during a turn.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_march	An army ordered to carry out a forced march gets a significant increase in the action points available to it, but is unable to initiate a battle. Furthermore, a marching army has a reduced line of sight, reflecting its focus on the job in hand; the drawback being that it is more susceptible to ambushes. If attacked, all units in a marching army suffer reduced morale to reflect the inherent surprise element. The resultant battle will always be an ambush.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_objectives	The objectives panel defaults to show your faction's chapter objectives, with bonus objectives available by clicking on the numbered buttons down the left-hand side.

A negative trait is acquired gradually from a certain pattern of behaviour and can usually be expunged by a continued display of the opposite behaviour.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_persian	Missile units occupy the front line with light cavalry on their flanks, then a second line of melee infantry with heavy cavalry on their flanks. This was a popular formation favoured by the Achaemenid Persians.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_persuasion	Your champion will attempt to use strength of character to persuade the target character to act in your faction’s favour. Their level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character, influences the success of this action. Authority can be increased through skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth_bonuses	Many buildings and technologies give bonuses to wealth. High-level buildings and late-game technologies give particularly significant boosts to a province’s wealth. Characters may also give wealth bonuses to any province they are in via their skills, traits, and ancillaries. Wealth bonuses provided by buildings increase the wealth production of all settlements within a province. Technology bonuses generally apply to all provinces within your empire. Wealth bonuses may apply either to wealth as a whole or be more specific and target only a single wealth type. These bonuses always apply to the whole province.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_mislead	This action disrupts the target army, temporarily reducing its general’s cunning by hindering his movements in battle and increasing the cooling down time before his own special abilities can be used again. Misleading command also reduces line of sight on the campaign map, making the army more vulnerable to further subterfuge. The success of this action depends on your dignitary’s zeal, which can be improved by skills, character traits, and the presence of household members or objects.	true

This means you can look for new allies to help if the war is not necessarily going your way. When they join you in a war, missions can be offered to all your allies, vassals, satrapies, etc. - although there is a chance they may not be accepted.

A simple yet effective device, sharpened stakes are set in 45 degree lines to impale charging men or horses. They can easily be navigated around when moving slowly, but even this can be used to the advantage of missile units.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_character_relentless	Despite being trapped by the Romans inside the walls of the Gallic city of Alesia, Vercingetorix kept up the pressure by constantly skirmishing with the besiegers in an effort to break out and ride for reinforcements. Eventually, this proved successful and a small contingent of cavalry escaped to rally surrounding tribes and attack the Romans from the rear.\\n\\nIn game, Vercingetorix can use this ability once during a battle to reduce the fatigue of all friendly units within a 300 metre radius for a period of 60 seconds.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_public_order_rebellions	Riots amongst the peasants can also escalate into full-scale rebellions, happening when a third of the unhappiness in a province is due to cultural unrest. The size of the rebel army is always linked to the level of the settlement in the region from which it has spawned.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_morale	Morale is a measure of a unit's confidence and spirit during a battle. During a lengthy, protracted melee, the morale of the men is severely tested, and they will break and rout if it gets too low. This is indicated by the coloured bar at the top of each unit’s banner; when it is green morale is healthy, when it turns yellow a morale penalty is in place, when it turns red the unit is wavering and about to break and rout. The presence of the general alone can improve morale and highly-trained, elite units have much higher morale from the outset. Heroes also improve morale of those around them by their presence. Generals can also rally their men more effectively by use of their special [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060s_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_rally.html"]]regroup position[[/url]], [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060m_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_land.html"]]inspire[[/url]] and [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060n_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_sea.html"]]encourage[[/url]] abilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances	Armies and fleets can be assigned stances which improve their movement rate, line of sight, and various attack and defence attributes. Often, there is a trade-off between positive and negative effects. Select an army or fleet and click on the dedicated button at the bottom of the screen to choose one. A force's stance represents how its capabilities change under a number of situations: mustering (recruitment), forced marching, ambushes, raiding on land or at sea, garrisoning settlements, fortifying (setting camp), rowing at double time or patrolling a sea region. Each one has its advantages and drawbacks, costs a number of action points to execute and once entered, the force will stay in that stance until given a different order. It is not possible for an army to enter a stance when on a transport ship at sea, but that transport ship will have it's own stances that can be adopted.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_agents_cunning	Cunning is a character’s understanding of their role and their capacity to carry it out. It is the ability to use strategy, tactics, techniques and tricks to achieve their ends, and also resist cunning agent actions. For agents, high cunning increases their line of sight on the campaign map; for generals, it reduces the cooling down time before their armies' abilities can be used again and unlocks the "strategist" set of abilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_experience	As a unit fights and survives battles, it gains experience points that improve its ability to deal with future combat situations. Their first experience level is gained by taking 25% casualties, regardless of the number of kills made. Amongst other things, experience increases [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html"]]morale[[/url]], so an experienced unit is then less likely to break and run from battle when under stress and [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html"]]fatigue[[/url]]. Generals also gain experience points upon successful conclusion of a battle that can be used to choose useful military [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/042_enc_manual_skills.html"]]skills[[/url]] for them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle	The battle panel presents you with several options for resolving the upcoming battle - fighting on the battlefield or seascape, resolving the battle automatically via a comparison of each force's statistics and withdrawing from the fight. If you withdraw when attacked there is a good chance that the attacking force will attack you again. If you have attacked a provincial capital there will also be options to continue the siege, to break it off, and to construct siege engines on-site for assaulting enemy settlements. Note that siege engines take a number of turns to complete before use. If you have more than twenty units they will automatically be fielded as a single force. If you wish to field twenty units and have any others appear as reinforcements you must uncheck the box on the battle panel.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth	An empire might be created by armies, but a strong economy is required in order to achieve stability. Income is made through the taxation of a province’s wealth and is then used to pay for the upkeep of your existing forces, to recruit new troops, and to construct new buildings. Each settlement has a certain amount of wealth produced by the buildings constructed there. The total wealth provided across all settlements within a province is referred to as provincial wealth. Wealth and all relevant bonuses to it are always province-wide. Wealth is turned into income through taxation, so if there is a normal tax rate and there are no other modifying factors present, all provincial wealth is income. This situation, however, rarely occurs.	true

Outnumbering the Romans, the Nervii force smashed into the Roman flank and successfully pushed through their battle line, almost cutting it in two.\\n\\nIn battle, Boduognatus can target a friendly unit once during a battle, increasing their attack capabilities and making their morale unbreakable for 60 seconds. In turn, the targeted unit has a chance of spreading these effects to other friendly units within a 30 metre radius of their position.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_training	The presence of a champion within a friendly army can boost their zeal and increase the experience for all units within it whilst the agent remains in their ranks. Zeal influences the morale of an army’s general and his bodyguard. It also improves their charge, melee attack, and missile attack skills. On the campaign map, zeal increases resistance to authoritarian agent actions, improves an army’s action points, and increases the profits from raiding. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your champion’s zeal and certain skills, traits and household members or objects they may have acquired.	true

In addition to zeal, the target character’s own cunning or the strategic abilities of the target general also affect this action’s chances of success. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and any household members or objects your agent may have with them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_fatigue	A unit that is resistant to [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html"]]fatigue[[/url]] will take longer to tire in battle.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_generals	The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. You can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are three attributes that unlock different categories of general’s ability: “Warrior”, which is unlocked by high zeal; “Commander”, which become available when authority is high; “Strategist”, which is dependent on high cunning. As a general or admiral improves each of his three attributes, he will progressively unlock further abilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_generals	Generals and admirals are used to command armies and fleets in battle. Their attributes influence the effectiveness with which their army or fleet fights, including their morale, so if one is killed in battle the shock of his death affects his troops and can cause them to waver or even rout. Generals and admirals can acquire skills, character traits, and household members or objects that affect their performance as they gain experience in battle and increase in rank, as well as cursus honorum offices to convey additional bonuses. Recruit a general or admiral by selecting a settlement and then clicking on the raise army or raise fleet button. Available candidates are displayed there. Select one and then click on the raise army or raise fleet button to hire him and begin mustering a force.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_legacies	When a force is first mustered it is named, given a unique emblem and, from that point on, creates its own legacy through its actions in the field. This enables the development of traditions that have positive effects in the same way that skills benefit the characters that have them. Some traditions are unique to certain factions, affecting aspects of both battles and campaigns. A force's legacy and traditions forever remain with its emblem, living on long after its original troops have succumbed to their fates. When a new force is raised, you can choose to hand down the legacy of its forebears to your newest recruits.	true

Appearing throughout the game in missions, incidents and dilemmas, as well as the faction summary tab, they are not just serving generals and admirals (commanders), but also statesmen at the faction capital. In political terms, statesmen are the same as commanders and have influence-contributing gravitas, but unlike commanders they don’t have a physical presence on the campaign map, instead holding positions in political office until a new army or fleet is raised and requires leadership. Additionally, a commander does not have to die to be replaced; you can replace him by selecting his army on the campaign map and navigating to the replace option on the general’s details panel. If you choose to put an existing statesman in command of an existing military force, a swap will occur and the previous commander will be removed from the field, becoming a statesman instead.\\n\\nConverting a statesman into an admiral or general has no financial cost. However, the pool of command candidates will frequently be populated by other characters that do cost money to recruit. This cost is not only for the creation of the new commander, but essentially also represents the cost of bringing characters out of civilian life and into politics. Rather importantly, they already have predefined allegiances towards certain parties and, once recruited, will appear on the faction summary tab and contribute gravitas to their party’s influence.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that both commanders and statesmen are always involved in party politics until their deaths, regardless of their presence on the battlefield. The notable difference between statesmen and commanders is that the latter are able to actively increase their own gravitas by winning battles. This could be a reason to replace one commander with another – in order to help increase the gravitas of a politically-inferior statesman by giving him the opportunity to attain military victory.\\n\\nMany command choices have potential political ramifications, but often circumstances do not make the choice so straightforward. For example, a large and ever-expanding empire (and therefore high imperium) is fighting a war far away from its faction capital in which a top general has just been killed. If the next-best candidate in the pool is an existing statesman representing an opposition party with ambition and high gravitas, appointing him as a replacement may increase his party’s influence - upsetting the balance and leading to civil war when most forces are away on foreign soil. It is therefore important to remember, when making a military decision, that there could be political ramifications that may not be immediately obvious.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_infrastructure_farms	Farms are positioned in the fields in rural areas away from settlements.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth_types	There are different types of wealth:\\n\\n* Agriculture (often produced by farms)\\n\\n* Culture (often produced by temples and city centre buildings)\\n\\n* Industry (often produced by industrial buildings and some ports)\\n\\n* Livestock (often produced by cattle or sheep buildings)\\n\\n* Local Commerce (often produced by city centre buildings and commercial ports)\\n\\n* Maritime Commerce (exclusively produced by commercial ports)\\n\\n* Subsistence (exclusively produced by main settlement buildings)\\n\\nAny type of wealth can be produced by any building as it is not the building chain that determines the type produced, but the building itself. For example, the agricultural chain can produce both agriculture and livestock wealth. The type of wealth produced by a building can be seen by mousing over its icon and checking the information panel in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. An overview of the total wealth produced by a settlement can be seen by mousing over the wealth display on the province details panel.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battlefield_victory	The scale of any victory in battle is measured by the number of casualties suffered by each side. However, in siege, port assault and encampment battles the attacker can capture key positions known as victory points. When two thirds of the available victory points have been captured, or the only one in the case of minor settlements or encampment battles, the defenders’ victory tickets will start to diminish by way of a countdown. The defender must reclaim their victory points to stop this happening or lose the battle when the number of tickets reaches zero. 	true

Trade agreements are hugely profitable for the factions involved. Once an agreement is in place, a trade route is established between the two, with any ports or settlements along it receiving a share of the income. The trade of natural resources influences their global prices by the law of supply and demand. Trade agreements continue until one party breaks the agreement, suffering a penalty to their diplomatic relations. Long-standing trade partners develop a healthy respect for each other, reflected by increased income from trade routes over the life of the agreement.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_imperium	Your faction’s imperium is a measure of your progress during a campaign as viewed by rivals within your faction. It can be increased by conquests. If your influence becomes too great you will be considered a threat by the other parties, at which point you will be declared an enemy of the state and a civil war will begin. As your imperium becomes great, politics has greater importance, because this is when it is most likely that civil war will occur. As your empire grows, it becomes more difficult to maintain stability within your faction. When full imperium has been achieved it is important to keep a very close eye on the situation, because fluctuations in influence may be more extreme. Also, keep in mind that you may not always be able to recruit a general from the ‘right’ party. Too much power results in a civil war against separatists; too little and those scheming to take advantage of your political weakness may attempt to oust you, snatching the leadership for themselves. It is therefore important to use the early game to learn how politics can help you, and, once your empire has grown, actively try to keep everything in balance.	true

Upon formation, your target faction ceases to act independently and their strongest armies and fleets become confederation property. Anyone already at war with the target faction may choose to declare war on every faction within it.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_experience_sea	Experience for ship crews works in the same way as it does for units, except that when a ship is unable to continue fighting - either due to surrender, routing or its destruction - all remaining experience points that its crew might have earned are instead split between the ships it was in combat against.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_deer	Missile infantry at the front, with light infantry behind, and light cavalry on the flanks. Heavy infantry and cavalry make up the last line.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_promotion	Promotion can only be secured for members of your ruling party and its effects are not entirely political. A character given higher political office will see an immediate boost to his gravitas. However, such promotions also bestow special Cursus Honorum traits, which also have their own effects. This action can be carried out multiple times (up to a maximum level) as long as the target character is the right age and rank required for each successive promotion.  At the first level, the cost is the support of a few patricians. With each promotion thereafter, there is an ascending financial cost in addition to the loss of support.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_boarding	Any naval ramming action can result in boarding. The boarding button orders your ship to close with the target vessel and sends an armed group aboard to capture it. This action can be cancelled at any time by issuing another, conflicting, order.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_visibility	In Total War: ROME II, visibility of enemy units depends entirely on what your own units can see at any given time, so, if the enemy are hidden by a building or the terrain itself, they may not be visible to your forces. By the same token, enemy units may disappear during a battle if they pass out of view of your troops. An eye icon appears above your unit when it is hidden or when it is out of the enemy’s line of sight. It will disappear when your unit has been spotted by the enemy. It’s also important to note that visibility is entirely separate to the hiding attribute. Although deployment enables the secret deployment of most units, ships and siege equipment cannot be hidden from the enemy due to their size.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_capture	There are a number of potential outcomes following a successful siege action.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_gravitas	Gravitas is a character’s popularity and standing in the Roman world and is the key factor in determining their party's influence. All the characters in a party contribute, but the effect is relative to the total gravitas of its rival parties. So, if an opposition party has several high-Gravitas members and you don't, the likelihood is that their influence will increase each turn, while yours will decrease.\\n\\nAlso remember that a character’s ambition can increase the effect their gravitas has on their party’s influence, so it is prudent to keep an eye on your generals, as victory increases personal ambition. The more ambitious a character is in relation to others, the more effect his gravitas will have on his party’s share of power.\\n\\nTo manipulate a party’s influence, increase or reduce the amount of gravitas their characters possess. For example, one could attempt to discredit a party by spreading rumours about some or all of its members, reducing their overall gravitas. However, assassination of a prominent opposition member might have an even greater effect, since all of a character’s contributing gravitas can be removed completely in one swift action. Conversely, adoption steals a character from another party, taking gravitas away from them and adding it to your own. More details will be given about political actions later on.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_fragments_merge	Forces that are not large enough to be effective could be destroyed if attacked by a superior force, so it is prudent to merge any fragments together. It is possible to merge two friendly armies or fleets together when neither is at full strength (a full strength force is twenty units in size). Merge by left-clicking on your first one and then right-clicking on the second. The first force will then move over to the second and the two will merge together. However, it is not possible to have more than one general within an army, so you must disband the lesser of the two after transferring his units. If there are twenty units or more in either force the merge panel will appear, so you can choose which units or ships to merge into a single force and which to leave behind.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_military_admin	A dignitary embedded in a friendly army can improve its general’s authority attribute and reduce upkeep costs. Authority represents the influence of the general over his army and their attack and defence capabilities, making it more resistant to subterfuge on the campaign map and potentially increasing its zone of control. The effectiveness of this action depends on your dignitary’s own authority, which can be increased with skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_hide	Ambush stance immobilises an army but increases its line of sight and makes it invisible to nearby enemy forces.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_civil_war	Politics in Total War: ROME II is about maintaining the balance of influence. Left unchecked, it is possible for stability to deteriorate to a point where the gulf in political power between the parties causes a civil war. If your party becomes too powerful in a republic, mistrust and paranoia ultimately lead to a challenge for control of your faction. At this point, civil war ensues; the remaining parties unite and lead rebel forces to capture the capital and overthrow your regime. Similarly, should you be deemed too weak, you may be exiled as an enemy of the state, with little choice but to lead your armies against the usurpers. In a tribal society or a monarchy, your tribe or family branch could be challenged should they be deemed weak, again leading to civil war. At this point, a new enemy faction emerges to attempt a coup d’état either at your faction capital or at the farthest point from it. The newly emerged faction is a direct result of the opposition to your party's rule within your own; it is not possible to engage in diplomacy with them, and they will always try to capture or hold your faction capital if the coup did not originate there. Civil war can only continue for a limited time, at which point they are automatically resolved by treaty, the terms of which are decided by the balance of power at the point of resolution.	true

They will attempt to retreat if things get out of control and won’t try to chase down retreating units to avoid getting enemy tricks and ruses. When using it, the following bonuses and penalties are applied: your spear infantry receives a bonus when fighting against cavalry, whilst mounted enemies get an attack bonus; missile units on both sides have their effectiveness increased; your units get a global defence bonus, whilst the enemy gets an attack bonus; forces will attempt to retreat if they suffer considerable losses.\\n\\nAdditionally, in sieges, if attacking, the more siege artillery you have (onagers, ballistas, etc.), the more effective your spear and melee infantry will become; if defending, the more spear and melee infantry you have, the smaller the enemy’s bonus for their siege engines (towers, ladders, etc.)	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_raid	When ordered into a raiding stance, your army or fleet draws income from nearby trade routes and settlements. This decreases its upkeep costs, but reduces its defensive capabilities and movement range on the campaign map. The amount of booty gained through raiding is relative to the size of your force and is deducted from the income of the route or settlement in question. Raiding in foreign territory harms diplomatic relations, but isn’t an overt act of war. In dire situations, a force may raid within its own territory, causing a degree of unrest as a result.	true

It is therefore sensible to upgrade buildings in the capital chain so living space expands to cope with a larger populace. Ignoring squalor eventually leads to public order problems.

It will not be possible to reload any save but the last one that occurred. On the battlefield legendary difficulty will carry the following restrictions: the tactical overview map will be minimised - it will not be possible to re-open it and it will not be possible to issue orders or move the camera when the battle is paused. It will only be possible to open the game menu and exit the battle, all enemy unit tooltips will be restricted to the type of unit and number of troops, camera movement will be limited to within 200 metres of any of your units, and any enemy units more than 600 metres away will function as if hiding.   	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_battle_sieges_levels	The wall-mounted defences of a settlement depend purely on the upgrade level of its main building. The size of the walls is always the same, but arrow and scorpio towers are added as the main building is upgraded, eventually leading to bastions, which are artillery platforms you can use to position a single scorpion, ballista, or onager. Due to this, a single piece of artillery placed upon a bastion has more effective ammunition than it would normally carry as part of a battery. As such, the following defences are available to besieged occupants:	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_skills	When a general fights battles or an agent carries out their mission they gain experience. With enough experience behind them they will increase in rank and skill points will be issued. At this stage they may invest a skill point towards acquiring a new skill or upgrading an existing one, allowing you to shape a character's career path. Skills require one point per upgrade and one point before they are awarded. Certain skills are associated with specific ranks, meaning that they cannot be acquired until the character has reached that skill’s rank requirement. 	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_diekplous	This formation is a formation of multiple columns, designed to break into an enemy line and pin their fleet down for one-on-one engagements. It is best used against a fleet formed of a single line.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces	A province consists of up to four regions, each one containing a settlement, the hub of activity within it and in which you can construct buildings to improve its strategic and economic potential, enabling growth. One of these is always the provincial capital, a major, walled settlement, whilst the remainder are minor settlements without defensive walls. Building construction improves the strategic and economic potential of settlements, enabling them to grow. Depending on settlement size and available resources, different chains of buildings are available for development. Over time, provincial growth enables you to develop settlements either by upgrading existing buildings or by constructing additional ones. Depending on settlement size and regional resources, different chains of buildings will become available for development. Coastal settlements can also contain port buildings that enable the construction of fleets.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_public_order_riots	When unhappiness becomes too great the people will riot.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_intercept	Your spy uses his authority to get access to orders issued to the target army, thus revealing the location and line of sight to another army, settlement or agent of the same faction. If there is nothing left to be revealed, the orders will involve a hitherto undiscovered faction. This action can also reveal the location of hidden armies. Authority can be increased via skills, traits and the presence of members of, or objects from, your spy’s household.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_ambush	An army positioned in a forest can sometimes launch an ambush against a passing enemy. If you decide not to launch an ambush, the army will pass without being alerted to your presence. If you choose to attack, your forces can be split between each side of the road and the enemy force will be deployed in marching, rather than battle, order. The enemy army will not have the opportunity to move their units in any way until the battle starts, so deploy carefully to cause maximum confusion and disorder. NB - If you are playing battles on hard or very hard difficulty and are ambushed it will not be possible to issue orders when the battle is paused.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_assassinate	Self-explanatory and with the most obvious effect – it completely removes target characters from the game. Killing a troublesome member of a faction is no small matter, so it comes with a considerable financial cost, alongside a small political cost. The target character may be ambitious with high gravitas, someone who is upsetting the balance by causing his party to gain excessive support. Even your own commanders or statesmen can be marked for death, your faction leader being the only exception. Characters with higher gravitas are harder to eliminate, so cost much more to assassinate. Also note that it is not possible to completely destroy a political party by killing off all members – the party always exists regardless and will be repopulated turn by turn.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_public_order	Obedience to the rule of your faction is measured in public order. The factors that affect it are displayed on the region details panel, and include elements such as settlement level, presence of a garrison and the size of the tax burden placed on the populace. If unhappiness begins to outweigh happiness it will accumulate, eventually leading to rebellion if left unchecked. Keep taxes at reasonable levels, maintain sufficient food supplies and ensure that settlements are garrisoned to stop low public order bubbling over into rioting or worse, full-scale rebellion.	true
