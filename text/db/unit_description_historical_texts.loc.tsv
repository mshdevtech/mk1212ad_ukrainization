unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_tra_ger	The byrding was a small coastal trading vessel, more manoeuvrable than the knarr or other, larger longships. This meant that they were more reliant on oars than their heavier brethren but were still light enough to be pulled onto the shore. The waters around Denmark were, and still are, incredibly treacherous; it is estimated that they contain 20,000 ship wrecks dating from the Stone Age up to the present day. These include a number of longships discovered in the harbour at Roskilde that now reside in the Viking Ship Museum. One of these is called Skuldelve 3 and is thought to be an excellent example of the byrding.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_mar_des_desert_corsairs_long	Naval warfare in the ancient world was just another way for infantry to fight one another. The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight. The distinction, then, in antiquity, between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_art_cel	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_heavy_mis_dbl_sco_eas	The word 'dromon' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes. At the very minimum a dromon had a crew of 200; 50 men to the lower bank of oars, 100 on the oars above, and 50 combat marines. It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram. Some were reported to carry pipe-like weapons used to project Greek Fire onto enemy ships.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_art_ger	Liburnians were small, compact galleys, ideal for patrolling the Roman coastlines. They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans. During the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire came under continued attack from increasingly stronger barbarian forces from the north and east. In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_tra_cel	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where ships could go. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_fyrd_slingers	The sling is one of the oldest ranged weapons in existence, possibly dating back to before the Neolithic period. Its use throughout history is evidenced by depictions upon Assyrian and Egyptian reliefs, as well as those of later times, such as Trajan's Column and the Bayeux Tapestry. A sling is essentially a length of material (usually leather, but sometimes stretched pig bladder) with a cradle in the centre to hold a stone. The slinger then holds the ends and spins the sling to generate momentum. By extending his arm and simultaneously increasing the force of the spin, then releasing the stone at the precise moment, the slingshot can be flung a large distance - far greater than would be possible without it. Many young people grew up throwing stones found on the river beds of Europe, giving them a natural advantage when applying the skill to combat. Rocks and stones were in ready supply so, whilst spears may have needed repair after a battle, slingers were always well provisioned. Often people of low status in society, and therefore in battle, slingers would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, providing a blanket of slingshots to hamper the enemy when charging. In return, the veterans would use their shields to safeguard the slingers as they unleashed their missiles. Slingshot could be an effective weapon against close enemy formations or cavalry.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_mounted_brigands_long	Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_thegns	As retainers of the Anglo-Saxon king, 'thegns' were de-facto noblemen, though in reality they ranked between freemen and those of actual noble blood. These men were, and had always been, warriors, rallying to their king's side during wartime to command the army. Some thegns became more powerful still, being directly involved with the running of the Saxon state in addition to their military duties. Despite this, thegns still formed the backbone of Anglo-Saxon armies and as such were better trained and equipped than the common, levied fyrd. In the past, their equivalent - the 'gesith' - were the tribal leader's personal companions, his stalwart retainers, champions, and defenders on the battlefield. Eventually, following the emergence of the European kingdoms during the Dark Ages, their services were rewarded with lands and titles as a precursor to the concept of fealty and vassalage.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_caledonian_axemen_long	Celtic warriors were ideally equipped to hack through even heavily-armoured foes. Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic troops, the lightly-armoured axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_thegn_spearmen	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_hippo_toxotai	'Equites sagittarii' is Latin for 'horse archers', specialist mounted units armed with bows who served as auxiliary units in the Roman army from the time of Augustus. This, like many adaptations made to the army's original model, was entirely due to contact with the powerful armies of the eastern empires - Parthia and later, Sassanid Persia. Horse archers were, therefore, far more likely to be found serving in the east, where they could match their opponents tactic for tactic in lightning runs and skirmishing. Additionally, the type of glue used in their composite bows would fail in the west due to its predominantly damp climate. Following the decline and collapse of the Western Empire, the Eastern Roman army continued to go from strength to strength, but due to its location there was, day to day, a gradual shift from the Latin language to Greek, so equites sagittarii became ‘hippo-toxotai’ – literally ‘horse archers’ in Greek.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_noble_skirm	Until very recently, when mechanisation reduced the amount of close-quarters fighting required, skirmishers were used to harass, never giving the enemy pause to regroup and distracting them until melee troops or cavalry could pin them down. In the ancient world, particularly among the 'civilised' states of the Mediterranean, many skirmishers were considered highly skilled, with places such as Crete and the Balearic Islands specialising in producing first class archers, slingers and javelineers. In the north and west of Europe, such weapons were generally thought considered cowardly - only fighting hand-to-hand in melee carried the required amount of honour and glory with it. As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blinded to an infantry or cavalry charge bearing down upon them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_godan's_warlord_long	Although thought spurious by the historian Paul the Deacon, the tale of the Winnili tribe is nevertheless the earliest account of the Langobard's connection with Godan (better known to us as Odin). When facing the Vandals, who entreated him for victory, the god told them that he would grant victory to the first army he saw on the day of battle. When the day came, Godan spotted the Winnili first, and asked "who are those long beards?" Following their victory, they became known as Langobards - literally 'Longbeards' - from that point on. In tribute, their 'wolf warriors' were impassioned by the 'dance' of Godan. Tribal elders imbued themselves with the spirit of the god in order to inspire younger warriors to feats of greatness in his name.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_sword_hirdmen	Originally a rare weapon of quite some prestige, the sword became more common in the early Middle Ages, with blades produced on a larger scale to more standardised specifications. The spatha of the Roman period became the basis of Viking and Carolingian longswords. These single-handed blades, with triangular pommels and short grips, were widely used, not only by the Viking Danes but right across Europe. Swords during the era were chiefly produced by the Franks and obtained by the Danes through either trade or, as is more likely, raiding, pillaging and looting of Frankish possessions. Although they were all of a roughly similar length, there were variances of several inches as, although they were more speedily produced, mass-production of arms and armour, and the standardisation and quality control that went with it, was still a rarity at that time.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_huscarls_long	Literally meaning ‘masters of the house’, ‘housecarls’ or ‘huscarls’ were free soldiers in the service of a Nordic warlord or king. Specifically, they acted as his bodyguard, fighting alongside and protecting him on the battlefield. If a lord was killed, his huscarls were duty-bound to avenge his death. Dressed head to foot in chainmail and carrying a shield, huscarls generally fought with swords or two-handed axes. Gradually, as Norse society progressed, they were elevated from being a mere fighting unit to positions within the royal court, where they were given the honour of sitting at the king’s table. By the end of the Dark Ages the name 'huscarl' was more broadly used to refer to anyone who directly served another, more powerful warrior. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_des_elite_nubian_archers_long	Nubian archers from the ‘Land of the Bow’ were famed for their skills and used as mercenaries by the Ptolemaic dynasty. Archery was valued in Nubian society: their gods and rulers were often depicted with bows or archer’s thumb rings, and their warriors were buried with bows, quivers, arrows and rings. The rings allowed archers to fully draw their powerful bows, as the shaped metal ring guarded their fingers. Several types of bow were employed, including the longbow and composite bow. There were also many types of arrowhead, some of which were barbed to make them more difficult to remove from a wound.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_hunters_long	The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, they had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant they often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_large_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_foederati_spears_long	Not quite allies in the traditional sense, but not strictly part of the Empire either, foederati were tribal groups living just outside the borders of Roman territory who were bound by treaty to provide military support. In return, they received subsidies from the Romans, usually food. At varying times the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Alani and even the Huns fought for Rome as foederati. The main problem with the foederati system was that constituent tribes tended to become unreliable over time, especially after a change of leader. Famously, the Goths became foederati of the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens but then rebelled, utterly defeating his army and killing him at Adrianople in AD378. In turn, the loss of a large part of Rome’s standing army resulted in greater reliance on foederati troops, which ultimately hastened the end of the Western Empire. As Imperial authority weakened, and pressure from the marauding steppe nomads increased, many foederati moved inside Roman provinces. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_thrall_skirmishers_long	Thralls were the slaves taken by the Nordic peoples as they raided the coastlines of northern Europe. As a result, most were captured from the coast of Britannia or on the Vikings' forays down the Volga River, where they became known as ‘Slavs’. The men who captured the thralls were known to the Mediterranean peoples as the ‘Rus’ – whose land eventually became Russia - or the ‘Varangians’, who of course served as unbiased Imperial bodyguards in the Byzantine Empire that succeeded the Eastern Romans. The lowest of the low in Nordic society, thralls were pressed into fighting and were often poorly-armed and armoured – the idea behind their use being that they would increase a Nordic army’s size until its opponents were overwhelmed by superior numbers, rather than their skill at arms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_posion_archers_long	Warriors have been using bows to hunt and fight since before recorded history. Since at least early antiquity, arrows have been dipped into poison to better (and more duplicitously) kill the enemy. The addition of a venomous substance to an arrowtip increases its effectiveness as, even if the bowman does not strike a direct hit, a glancing blow that breaks the skin is all that is required for the toxin to get into an opponent's bloodstream. Although some the earliest evidence of poison arrows lies in Greek mythology, Alexander the Great spoke of enemy bowmen firing toxic arrows during his invasion of India in 326BC and there is also empirical evidence of poison-tipped bolts being used by the Gauls, Romans and Scythians.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_screaming_women_long	Unlike their 'civilised' counterparts, barbarian women had power within their societies, and were not to be crossed. On the battlefield, they tended the wounded, brought supplies forward, and inspired courage. With a strong sense of personal honour, they called down the gods' curses and swore vengeance on anyone who wronged them. Although without formal positions in tribal politics, in some societies a woman could still inherit the influence of her husband or father, and this could be used to take terrible vengeance. Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni from eastern Britannia, is a prime example of a powerful woman - the revolt she started threatened to drive the Romans from Britain altogether.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_heavy_mel_nor	The drekkar or 'dragon ship' takes its name from the detailed carvings that decorated its prow. Adorned with dragons or snakes, it was designed to ward off the terrifying sea creatures that many people believed inhabited the dark places of the oceans - creatures like the kraken, a terrifying giant squid that could pull whole ships down to the depths, or the undead draugen. These reanimated corpses were men lost at sea that legend states appear during storms and on rough seas to sink boats. Some say that they could alter their size to monstrous proportions, others that they were covered in seaweed or were in fact headless.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_kings_fianna	In Celtic Ireland, ‘fianna’ were independent bands of men and women, often aristocratic but yet to inherit, who proved their mettle in service of a local lord. As such, they were supplied with food and shelter during the winter months in return for keeping the peace. In the summer, the members of the fianna – known as ‘fian’ – had to hunt for their own food, making additional income from selling the pelts of animals they had eaten. Fianna and their exploits are featured heavily in Irish folklore, particularly the Ulster Cycle - in which a band of twenty-seven fian are led by the druid Cathbad - and the Fenian Cycle – in which the mythical warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill leads them to victory against the enemies of the High King.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_warlords_guard_long	Warrior societies in antiquity were, predictably, based very much on strength - the strongest man would become the leader, and only through remaining strong would he retain that position. Those around him, envious of his strength and desirous of his power, would work to undermine him whenever they saw the opportunity arise. To this end, the closest and most trusted and loyal of the chieftain's friends and companions acted as his bodyguards, fighting with him in battle and sharing in his victories and defeats. As the Middles Ages dawned, the dedication of these men to their kings was rewarded with titles, lands and power - such was the case with the thegns and huscarls of the later Saxon and Lombard kingdoms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_levy_freemen	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_spahbed_long	The Spahbed was a Persian military chief, equivalent to a modern Field Marshal. From the time of the Archaemenids and the Parthians, the Spahbed was a single man wielding supreme command over the Persian armed forces. This tradition continued into the early Sassanid Empire, with the 'Eran-spahbed' holding seniority over all Imperial forces. At the dawn of the 6th century, however, the Sassanid king, Khosrau I, established reforms to reduce the totalitarian power of the Spahbed, splitting the role into four regional chiefs - north, east, south and west. The eastern Spahbed, due to his entrenched position in the mountains, is said to have endured long after the Islamic conquest of Sassanid territory, becoming king of his small land until the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_night_raiders	Although mounted troops are terrifying and effective as shock cavalry, charging down enemy lines and wreaking havoc, they also performed another, equally important function on the battlefields of the early Middle Ages. Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horses were excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen force for their main host, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks. More nimble melee cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreating before the enemy could effectively counter-attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_royal_knights	The mounted knights of the Middle Ages have their origins in the 'ordo equester' cohorts of the Roman state cavalry, as well as the privately-funded household cavalry ('bucellarii') of late-period Rome. Being privately funded, the bucellarii were afforded better armour and training than other equestrians, and this focus on training, armour and weaponry was the basis of the emerging knight's skillset. The cataphract horsemen of the east, donned in armour that covered both rider and his powerful steed, were also an influence. In Europe, the Franks bred the 'Barb' horse, a sturdy and hot-blooded north African breed (the name meaning 'Berber') capable of coping with both heavy armour and the punishing demands of warfare. These horses were the tools that allowed Charlemagne's strategy to be realised across Europe. The horsemen, for their efforts, were rewarded with lands and titles. In the centuries following Charlemagne's rule, these men and their descendants went on to solidify their power, evolving into an elite warrior class by the beginning of the Medieval period.	true

The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the early Middle Ages, the Frankish navy was of no real distinction, yet Charlemagne did maintain a sizeable navy to defend against Viking raids, which was something other kingdoms generally failed to do. At the time, the distinction between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_raiders_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces. Brought up on the traditions of feasting and raiding, they craved the opportunity to prove themselves against a worthy enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_heavy_mis_wr	Liburnians were small, compact galleys, ideal for patrolling the Roman coastlines. They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans. During the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire came under continued attack from increasingly stronger barbarian forces from the north and east. In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_axemen_long	The axe became more and more prevalent due to its effectiveness in penetrating the heavier types of armour beginning to come into use during late antiquity. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, could be used to pull aside or split shields, and were effective against plate or chainmail armour. This was because, even if it didn't find the optimum angle to split it, a blow could still shatter bones and crush the organs beneath. One-handed axes may have been the most practical to carry and use, but two-handed variants were also common - the bearer requiring great upper-body strength to pick the weapon up and swing it repeatedly in combat. Nomadic warriors such as the Sarmatians sometimes wielded the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe with both a bladed and a hammer-like head, plus a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter.  	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_mounted_marz_archers_long	Born from a tradition of raiding nomadic tribesmen, mounted archery became firmly established in the ancient world, leading to some highly effective battlefield units. While foot archers could be equipped with longer, more powerful bows, the mounted archer was still a formidable opponent thanks to the design of the composite bow. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden variety. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina to use well, the composite bow demanded respect, care and attention. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_horse_stabbers_long	Unconventional tactics often led to victory through their ingenuity and the resultant confusion they cause among the enemy, and there are few as unconventional as horse hewing. First noted as swift 'runners' who backed up charioteers during the Bronze Age in Pharaonic Egypt. The first account of "horse-stabbing" is by Caesar during his Gallic conquests. Caesar recounts the effectiveness of the enemy, who broke his horsemen and terrified their steeds. He was so impressed that, upon their defeat, he drafted horse hewers into his army and used them in future campaigns. The Alamans are known to have fielded them in AD357, converting them from partial, guerrilla units into full regiments of warriors.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_mar_rom_roman_transport_crew_long	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods around the Mediterranean, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of Greek settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where Greek ships could reach. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_cheiroballista	At close targets a 'ballista' could be aimed accurately, but at a cost in range; it could only fire around 500 metres. The machine used two torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, giving incredible power for its size. Firing either solid shot or bolts, it was equally effective against infantry or cavalry, but could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized 'oxybeles' composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_wh_kindred_of_the_sun_long	Mihirakula was one of the most accomplished rulers of the Hephthalites, ruthlessly executing campaigns of expansion in the east throughout the 6th century AD. Indian sources record him extracting tribute from the Gupta Empire before he was captured and imprisoned. He escaped, and, finding his throne usurped by his brother, raised a rebellion against another local king. Once restored to power, Mihirakula resumed his campaigns and earned himself a reputation as one of the great enemies of the Buddhist faith. The name Mihirakula means “family of the sun” in both Sanskrit and Iranian. This demonstrates both the emerging mythological associations of the Hephthalite royal family and the ways in which they absorbed an amalgamated Iranian and Indian traditions and languages into their own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_armoured_himyarite_shotelai_long	The shotel is a thin, broadly circular bladed sword. It is often referred to as a 'sickle sword', a term applied to many similar curved weapons, such as the scimitar, the Persian shamshir and the Egyptian khopesh. Shotelai fought exclusively with the shotel, using the blade's shape to strike around their opponent's shields, penetrating their defences and hitting them in key areas; the kidneys or the lungs were common targets. The blade on a shotel varied from that of a shamshir or a kopesh as it was nearly a full semicircle, making it more awkward for the user to wield. In the hands of an experienced swordsman, however, its potential for death was magnified. 	true

They were famous for their unusual, relaxed attitude to breeding - where everyone belonged to everyone else - which instilled a sense of brotherhood and common purpose within the tribe in order to prevent in-fighting. The Agathyrsi were also known for their fearsome appearance. Their blue hair and tattooed bodies were frightening on the battlefield and an unusual sight away from it; the amount of coverage indicating a warrior’s position within his tribe.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_norse_berserkers_long	Howling like animals and biting their shields, berserkers took on the appearance of wild animals, entering battle in an almost trance-like state. Worked into a rage before combat, possibly through the use of drugs, they had little protection but were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade and indeed any blow that came their way. At the time, berserkers were thought to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria. However, their intended victims did not have the luxury of considering the opponent that stood before them; berserkers fought with a reckless fury, making them very uncompromising opponents to face, and to slay a berserker was thought a most impressive act of courage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_crossbows_long	Thought to have been invented simultaneously in both Greece and China during the 5th century BC, various forms of crossbow spread rapidly across Europe, even appearing on Pictish standing stones in the far north of Britannia. An early attempt to automate the simple bow, the crossbow works by mounting a bow horizontally on a barrel or stock that, once fitted with a ‘bolt’, can be drawn with a ratchet mechanism to much greater tension than a man alone can generate before being braced against the shoulder for firing. This means that, despite the superior accuracy and rates of fire afforded by the traditional bow, the crossbow can penetrate heavy armour more effectively. Also, unlike the bow, which takes many years of training and practice to master, an unskilled man can be taught to use a crossbow well within a week. Comparably poor accuracy was the weapon’s only real downside, but since it could be held in tension for a much longer period of time, crossbowmen often had time to pick and choose their shots carefully.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_longboat	Literally meaning ‘long ship’ or 'long boat' in the Gaelic language, the ‘long fhada’ can claim heritage from the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the Nordic peoples. Of course, the Norsemen didn’t just give their prized technology away, but their persistent raids of the Scottish,  Irish and Welsh coasts meant that longships were sometimes captured, enabling the Celts to study their construction in depth. Eventually, they produced the ‘birlinn’ and ‘Irish galley’, variants on the longship with between eight and twelve oars, in addition to a large sail. These features allowed the new breed of Celtic ships to easily cross the open sea for the purposes of trade and war, rather than having to remain close to the coastline at all times. Unfortunately, no remains of Celtic long boats/long fhada survive to this day, despite records of their continuous use until the 17th century.	true

The driver sat astride the beast’s neck while two men, armed with javelins, were in the howdah. Indian elephants first came to the Middle East when Seleucus, one of Alexander the Great’s Successors, invaded India in 305BC.

As a collection of tribes, Berbers brought great diversity and skill to the caliphate's army. Their cavalry was of particular note; the Berber being proficient cavalrymen who fielded lightly-armoured, mounted raiders atop excellent Arabian horses. The cavalrymen of the Zenata tribe became known as 'jinetes', who found that switching to horses from camels greatly improved their usefulness on the battlefield. As a result of the caliphate's relentless advance into the Iberian Peninsula, the north African natives soon found themselves fighting the Spanish, who later adapted the jinete cavalry model as they fought back against Islam during the Reconquista.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_levy_archers	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

They were so named for always numbering exactly ten thousand - if any man died or fell ill, he was immediately replaced; in this way the unit never 'died' - it was immortal. They fought famously at the Battle of Thermopylae, flanking the redoubtable Spartans and ultimately securing victory. Although disappearing with the Archaemenids, the Immortals were revived under the Sassanids as an elite corps of honour guards, with the finest armour and weapons of their entire military, and adorned in fine livery to demonstrate their prestige.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_nobles_long	Whereas German tribes often fought in a more ordered, organised manner than the Celts, they sometimes adopted their neighbours’ weapons and equipment, either through battle or trade. Celtic armour found its way onto the backs of privileged German warriors, while double-edged longswords were another example of creeping Celtic influence. An iron sword was a prestigious possession, so those who carried them were either of noble blood or were veteran followers. By following a noble, warriors were duty-bound to show dedication and valour. If he fell in combat, the noble’s men were expected to fight to the death. Anyone who survived such a battle was disgraced. Some hanged themselves, unable to live with the shame and dishonour of outliving their battle-lord.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_nokkors_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_seax_warriors	In Old English, the word 'seax' simply means 'knife'. Specifically, the seax is a dagger, usually made of iron, with a single edge. It was commonly used by the Saxon tribes from at least the Migration Period into the early Middle Ages - and is in fact the etymological root of the tribe's name, used by the Romans to differentiate one 'barbarian' enemy from another. There were many types of seax, with differences in length and breadth but retaining basic design of a wooden hilt into which the blade is fitted. Used for hunting as well as battle, one of the most famous examples is the 'Seax of Beagnoth', discovered in the riverbed of the River Thames in southern England and named for its owner, whose name is inscribed along the blade. Beagnoth also inscribed the runic alphabet along the blade, notably making distinct errors in the transcription and messily rectifying his mistake.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_barbarian_heavy_raider	Most of the Northern European tribes were not naval powers but there were able seafarers to be found there. Shipbuilding techniques were well understood so, while the many vessels were small leather-skinned boats for inland and inshore use, bigger sea-going vessels were made. Shipwrights used heavy planking for the hulls, stitched together and then fastened to a wooden skeleton to create sturdy craft which were able to cope with Atlantic conditions. Julius Caesar was surprised at the quality of the enemy ships when his fleet clashed with the Veneti from modern-day Brittany. The Veneti vessels had flat bottoms so they could cope with shallows, but were also of heavy oak construction to cope with rough seas. This made them tough opposition for the Roman galleys, and capable of shrugging off a ramming attack. Caesar says the enemy ships were constructed of “...planks a foot in breadth, were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb; the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables”. When the Romans were forced to board, they faced fearsome warriors used to close-quarter fighting at sea.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_vandal_berserkers_long	Originally thought to be from Scandinavia, and settling in Poland during the 2nd century BC, the Vandals were a confederation of Germanic tribes who went on to successfully migrate down through Europe and into Africa, forming a kingdom there in AD439. They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_mounted_brigands_long	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true

Amongst them were the Gyan-avspar, the 'sacrificers of their lives', known as the best of the Pushtighban, they were willing to give their lives in the name of their king, as they did with gusto during the Roman Emperor Julian's invasion of Persia.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_warband_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces. Brought up on the traditions of feasting and raiding, they craved the opportunity to prove themselves against a worthy enemy.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_scola_knights	The mounted knights of the Middle Ages have their origins in the 'ordo equester' cohorts of the Roman state cavalry, as well as the privately-funded household cavalry ('bucellarii') of late-period Rome. Being privately funded, the bucellarii were afforded better armour and training than other equestrians, and this focus on training, armour and weaponry was the basis of the emerging knight's skillset. The cataphract horsemen of the east, donned in armour that covered both rider and his powerful steed, were also an influence. In Europe, the Franks bred the 'Barb' horse, a sturdy and hot-blooded north African breed (the name meaning 'Berber') capable of coping with both heavy armour and the punishing demands of warfare. These horses were the tools that allowed Charlemagne's strategy to be realised across Europe. The horsemen, for their efforts, were rewarded with lands and titles. In the centuries following Charlemagne's rule, these men and their descendants went on to solidify their power, evolving into an elite warrior class by the beginning of the Medieval period.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_elite_germanic_archers_long	The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, they had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant they often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_heavy_mel_cel	Literally meaning ‘long ship’ in the Gaelic language, the ‘long fhada’ can claim heritage from the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the Nordic peoples. Of course, the Norsemen didn’t just give their prized technology away, but their persistent raids of the Scottish and Irish coasts meant that longships were sometimes captured, enabling the Celts to study their construction in depth. Eventually, they produced the ‘birlinn’ and ‘Irish galley’, variants on the longship with between eight and twelve oars, in addition to a large sail. These features allowed the new breed of Celtic ships to easily cross the open sea for the purposes of trade and war, rather than having to remain close to the coastline at all times. Unfortunately, no remains of Celtic long fhada survive to this day, despite records of their continuous use until the 17th century.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_elite_ostrogothic_pikemen_long	Originally migrating from the Baltic coast, the Goths settled in the Black Sea area but fragmented once their population outgrew the capacity of the region's natural resources. Following the departure of the Tervingi to the west, the Greuthungi continued to live in the area until pressure from Hunnic incursions, around AD370, caused a large part of the remaining population to migrate south into the Balkans and, crucially, Roman territory. Those left behind eventually became clients of the Huns, alternately rebelling and fighting for them in the west, notably at Chalons in AD451. Following the collapse of the Hunnic powerbase mid-way through the 5th century AD, with the Roman Empire in the west soon to follow, the surviving Greuthungi moved down into the Balkans, becoming known as the 'Ostrogoths' - literally 'Goths of the Rising Sun' or 'Eastern Goths'.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_tra_nor	The byrding was a small coastal trading vessel, more manoeuvrable than the knarr or other, larger longships. This meant that they were more reliant on oars than their heavier brethren but were still light enough to be pulled onto the shore. The waters around Denmark were, and still are, incredibly treacherous; it is estimated that they contain 20,000 ship wrecks dating from the Stone Age up to the present day. These include a number of longships discovered in the harbour at Roskilde that now reside in the Viking Ship Museum.

In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_frankish_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_alani_horsemen_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_skirmishers_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_nordic_skirmishers_long	The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young people aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for younger members to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_chieftain_long	Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_kushite_mounted_shotelai_long	The shotel is a thin, broadly circular bladed sword. It is often referred to as a 'sickle sword', a term applied to many similar curved weapons, such as the scimitar, the Persian shamshir and the Egyptian khopesh. Shotelai fought exclusively with the shotel, using the blade's shape to strike around their opponent's shields, penetrating their defences and hitting them in key areas; the kidneys or the lungs were common targets. The blade on a shotel varied from that of a shamshir or a kopesh as it was nearly a full semicircle, making it more awkward for the user to wield. In the hands of an experienced swordsman, however, its potential for death was magnified. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_thracian_warriors_long	Called by the Roman historian Livy, along with the Gauls, “…the most warlike of all nations”, the Thracians were renowned warriors whose prowess in battle made them much sought after as mercenaries. As skilled horsemen and infantry who excelled in light tactics, Thracians provided up to one third of the cavalry in the Macedonian army and a fifth of its infantry. In the Imperial age, Thracians were one of the largest auxiliary groups within the Roman army, contributing some 20,000 troops. As well as being famed for their prowess in battle, they also bore a reputation for joy in plunder and a vicious disregard for captives. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_select_archers	Whilst archers had their place in the battle lines of Anglo-Saxon armies they were never used in large numbers, as traditional military values placed greater importance on melee infantry and the glory to be gained through hand-to-hand combat; for instance, only one archer is depicted amongst the English forces on the Bayeux Tapestry. Whilst a thegn may have been trained in how to use a bow as a hunting weapon, standard fyrdmen would not have had that advantage. Those who were, however, commonly used the longbow - which became more common across Europe during the early Middle Ages. Made of yew or ash, with bowstrings of looped and corded linen, longbows were superior to selfbows. British proponents of the longbow, mainly the English and Welsh, became renowned for their skill with the weapon in later centuries - the most famous example being the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, when English archers were key to the defeat of a supposedly-superior French army.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_unnigarde_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_magister_militum_long	The supreme generals of the Roman Empire during 4th and 5th centuries AD were given the title ‘Magister Militum’. It was a prestigious position, that, when awarded to a particularly shrewd or political animal, held power rivalling, and sometimes outstripping, even that of the Emperor. Originally created during the reforms of Constantine the Great the title initially covered two specific positions, the Magister Equitum, ‘Master of the Horse’ and Magister Peditum, ‘Master of the Foot’. Over the years these roles merged, with generals who held both titles simply referred to as Magister Militum, ‘Master of Soldiers’. Separate Magister Militums were installed within each Roman territory. The great irony, when viewed in hindsight, is that the position was originally created by Constantine to rob one particular political foe of power, the usually-treacherous Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. However, those who held it generally became the bane of the Emperors they claimed to serve or, as on numerous occasions, the real power behind the throne. 	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_elite_highland_archers_long	Two tribal groups dominate the history of Scotland in ancient times. The Picts lived in northern and eastern Britannia, and successfully drove away all attempts to take the fertile lowlands of their homeland for hundreds of years. The Scoti was the collective term used to describe the tribes that sailed from Hibernia, modern-day Ireland, to raid the northern coasts of Roman Britain. By the end of the 5th century they had gained a foothold over the Pictish kingdoms, forming the territory of Dal Riata on the west coast of what is now Scotland. From AD360 onwards they are thought to have taken part in the so-called 'great conspiracy' of barbarians, a continual harassment of Rome's northern outposts that lasted until the withdrawal of the Legions in AD412.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_large_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_gesithas_long	Arguably the first time the 'Saxones' - an aggressive Germanic tribe - was mentioned was by the Egyptian writer Claudius Ptolemy in 'Geographia', during the 2nd century AD. At the time they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia. Over the ensuing years, they settled there in large numbers, eventually becoming known as the 'English' and the place, 'England'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_levy_long	The Celtic client system meant that a 'freeman' was given opportunities by the tribal hierarchy. He had to serve the noble classes, but he could also earn prestige in his own right. A freeman inevitably became the follower of an aristocrat, working on the land and raising livestock. However he also had the right to bear arms and fight alongside the nobles during times of war. In combat, a Celt could prove his worth, making a reputation for himself. This system caused an appetite for battle amongst the ambitious lower classes. This did not mean that their armies were ill-disciplined or haphazard: their cavalry used 'trimarcisia', where each rider went into battle with a pair of freeman servants, ready to supply fresh mounts or replace a warrior who fell.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_tribesmen_long	The desert is a harsh and unforgiving place, yet it is home to many all the same. The people who lived there travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_freemen_long	The Franks were originally a group of Germanic tribes, formed along the Rhine frontier, who, in the 3rd century AD, migrated westwards to settle in Gaul and as far south as northern Hispania. Although technically a barbarian incursion which they at first resisted, Rome eventually recognised the new Frankish kingdom in around AD357. In return, many Franks fought alongside the Roman army as foederati after that date. Observing the Franks, the Roman historian Sidonius Apollinaris spoke of a love of fighting bred into their young from an early age, stating "it is their sport to send axes hurling through the vast void and know beforehand where the blow will fall, to whirl their shields, to outstrip with leaps and bounds the spears they have hurled, and reach the enemy first".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_sword_warriors	Originally a rare weapon of quite some prestige, the sword became more common in the early Middle Ages, with blades produced on a larger scale to more standardised specifications. The spatha of the Roman period became the basis of Viking and Carolingian longswords. These single-handed blades, with triangular pommels and short grips, were widely used, not only by the Viking Danes but right across Europe. Swords during the era were chiefly produced by the Franks and obtained by the Danes through either trade or, as is more likely, raiding, pillaging and looting of Frankish possessions. Although they were all of a roughly similar length, there were variances of several inches as, although they were more speedily produced, mass-production of arms and armour, and the standardisation and quality control that went with it, was still a rarity at that time.	true

One tale suggests they are the children of the Djinn, seraphic servants of King Solomon who remained on earth after their lord's death. Another legend states that the Kurds were founded by Melik Kurdim, a follower of Noah, after the biblical flood. Whatever their origins, the Kurds were first noted as mercenary slingers for the Seleucid Empire and Parthia. They are not referred to as 'Kurds', however, until the time of the Sassanids, when the founder of the empire, Ardashir, battled the Kurds and their leader, Madig. Their loyalty was fluid; they provided military support for both Eastern Rome and the Sassanids throughout antiquity, depending on which power was in overall control of their homelands at the time.	true

The Notitia Dignitatum gives a fairly comprehensive list of units classified as auxilia palatina but does not give any direct reference to the strength of those troops.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_contarii_long	Although the Roman Empire was responsible for countless military advances during its tenure, it couldn’t realistically claim to be responsible for them all. The cataphracts of Parthia – the shock cavalry of the ancient age, armoured from head-to-toe and wielding lances - devastated the Legions at Carrhae in 53BC and again at Nisibis in AD217. This, in combination with the increasing number of incursions by steppe nomads, who also fielded heavy lancers, caused the Roman army to begin modelling its own tactics around similarly heavy cavalry. Thus were formed the 'equites catafractarii' in several variants to fulfil specific functions on the battlefield, such as clibinarii and contarii, heavy horsemen armed with lances. The lance used was a deadly weapon; known as a ‘contus’, it was a long, thrusting spear that probably required the use of both hands. To wield such a weapon whilst simultaneously handling a horse on the charge must have taken great skill, proving that contarii were exceptional mounted soldiers.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_gothic_lancers	Developed during the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts of Parthia and its successor, Sassanid Persia. In fact, the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled his horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later, Rome faced it again at the hands of the steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. Having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors. The Ostrogothic people, having inherited Rome's administrative and military infrastructures when they subsumed the remnants of the Western Empire, fielded the contus against their enemies in the same way.	true

The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight. The distinction, then, in antiquity, between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_ravenna_elite_ballistarii_long	The Notitia Dignitatum lists many Legions under the title of 'ballistarii'. Whilst this translates simply as 'artillery', the existence of crossbow (then known as manuballistae) units in such large numbers, as recorded in the Notitia, indicates that balistarii referred to crossbow-armed foot soldiers, rather than full-size ballistae and their crews. Whilst many types were developed in ancient times, Roman crossbows bore similarities to later Medieval weapons, rather than being modelled on the Greek gastraphete. Operated by inserting the bolt and pulling it into place using a lever or crank, more torsion was created than a human could achieve without aid. The bolt, when released, fired with much more power than an arrow, and was therefore able to penetrate much thicker armour.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_highland_archers_long	Two tribal groups dominate the history of Scotland in ancient times. The Picts lived in northern and eastern Britannia, and successfully drove away all attempts to take the fertile lowlands of their homeland for hundreds of years. The Scoti was the collective term used to describe the tribes that sailed from Hibernia, modern-day Ireland, to raid the northern coasts of Roman Britain. By the end of the 5th century they had gained a foothold over the Pictish kingdoms, forming the territory of Dal Riata on the west coast of what is now Scotland. From AD360 onwards they are thought to have taken part in the so-called 'great conspiracy' of barbarians, a continual harassment of Rome's northern outposts that lasted until the withdrawal of the Legions in AD412.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_heavy_mel_eas	The word 'dromon' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes. At the very minimum a dromon had a crew of 200; 50 men to the lower bank of oars, 100 on the oars above, and 50 combat marines. It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram. Some were reported to carry pipe-like weapons used to project Greek Fire onto enemy ships.	true

As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_sword	The difficulty of obtaining iron in the early Middle Ages, combined with a lack of understanding of how to mass-produce welded weaponry meant that iron-forged blades were the weapons of noblemen who could afford the otherwise-prohibitive cost. Blades in the early Middle Ages were created through a process known as 'pattern welding', where iron rods, twisted together and ground down, formed a soft, carbonised centre for the blade that helped it better absorb the shock of a blow. Around this core, thin iron plates were then 'carburized' (hardened, essentially) onto the blade to give it increased strength. This style of layering metal pieces over each other gave blades a distinctive banding pattern, similar in appearance to the age-rings of a tree trunk.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_royal_thegns	As retainers of the Anglo-Saxon king, 'thegns' were de-facto noblemen, though in reality they ranked between freemen and those of actual noble blood. These men were, and had always been, warriors, rallying to their king's side during wartime to command the army. Some thegns became more powerful still, being directly involved with the running of the Saxon state in addition to their military duties. Despite this, thegns still formed the backbone of Anglo-Saxon armies and as such were better trained and equipped than the common, levied fyrd. In the past, their equivalent - the 'gesith' - were the tribal leader's personal companions, his stalwart retainers, champions, and defenders on the battlefield. Eventually, following the emergence of the European kingdoms during the Dark Ages, their services were rewarded with lands and titles as a precursor to the concept of fealty and vassalage.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_mounted_warriors_long	The Persian war machine differed greatly from that of the west. Gone was the reliance on a backbone of columns and infantry; instead, the eastern empires fielded heavy cataphracts, drawn from the nobility, as their main strength. These powerful shock troops were complimented by horse or camel archers, to harry the enemy and keep them under pressure. On foot, the Persians fielded light spearmen levies supported by an elite division of archers to back the cavalry and rain death upon the enemy. Also, the cataphracts were often aided by the hammer-blow of the terrifying elephant corps, upon which great importance was placed due to its magnificent power.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_dromonian_galley	The maritime strength of the Umayyad Caliphate was never in doubt, having successfully held Narbonne with a minimal garrison for over forty years almost entirely due to the skill of their seamen. With abundant timber resources at their disposal the ships they fielded were larger than the standard dromon-class vessels of the time, even producing large galleys. Although they generally used their fleet for raiding, as the centuries progressed the Umayyads expanded their maritime activities to directly engaging other ships at sea, combating the navy of the rival Fatimid Caliphate a dramatic move to solidify their power over the western Mediterranean.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_axemen	Although the vast majority of Germanic warriors fought with spears - even as the Middle Ages dawned - the axe became more and more prevalent due to its effectiveness in penetrating the heavier types of armour of the period. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, could be used to pull aside or split shields, and were effective against plate or chainmail armour as, even if it didn't find the optimum angle to split it, a blow could still shatter bones and crush the organs beneath. One-handed axes may have been the most practical to carry and use, but two-handed axes were also common - the bearer requiring great upper-body strength to pick the weapon up and swing it repeatedly in combat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nom_hunnic_horse_archers_long	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_spear_warriors	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_mounted_javelinmen_long	Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_afar_swordsmen_long	Referred to as "Han’e" in Ge’ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia, the ‘gile’ is a sickle-like sword. Its curved blade is deadly sharp and was used to strike behind an opponent’s shield at unprotected areas. Unlike the shotel, which it most-closely resembles, both the upper and lower part of the gile's blade is sharpened. As a result, it could be used to slash from side to side or up and down, frequently inflicting mortal wounds in the process. The gile's unusual shape also meant it could be hooked around the top of its bearer’s own shield in order to brace for an incoming charge. Grave goods and art of the period reveals that the sword was popular, and possibly originated, among the northern Ethiopian Afar tribe before spreading across eastern Africa.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_captured_cheiroballistra_long	At close targets a 'ballista' could be aimed accurately, but at a cost in range; it could only fire around 500 metres. The machine used two torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, giving incredible power for its size. Firing either solid shot or bolts, it was equally effective against infantry or cavalry, but could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized 'oxybeles' composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy.	true

Twenty percent of the original timbers have survived and been painstakingly restored, while the rest of the ship is represented by a huge metal frame to give a sense of scale.

Celtic armour found its way onto the backs of privileged German warriors, while double-edged longswords were another example of creeping Celtic influence. An iron sword was a prestigious possession, so those who carried them were either of noble blood or were veteran followers. By following a noble, warriors were duty-bound to show dedication and valour. If he fell in combat, the noble’s men were expected to fight to the death.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_royal_huscarls_long	Literally meaning ‘masters of the house’, ‘housecarls’ or ‘huscarls’ were free soldiers in the service of a Nordic warlord or king. Specifically, they acted as his bodyguard, fighting alongside and protecting him on the battlefield. If a lord was killed, his huscarls were duty-bound to avenge his death. Dressed head to foot in chainmail and carrying a shield, huscarls generally fought with swords or two-handed axes. Gradually, as Norse society progressed, they were elevated from being a mere fighting unit to positions within the royal court, where they were given the honour of sitting at the king’s table. By the end of the Dark Ages the name 'huscarl' was more broadly used to refer to anyone who directly served another, more powerful warrior. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_pictish_nobles	The Picts lived in northern and eastern Britain, and successfully drove away all attempts to take the fertile lowlands of their homeland for hundreds of years. Despite defeating the Picts at Mons Graupius around AD83, the Romans never fully conquered their lands, building a wall on the orders of Emperor Hadrian in order to control Pictish raids and martial their trade with the Britons. Where knowledge of terrain was key, the Picts used the land to their advantage, drawing invaders deep into their territory before giving battle. After the Romans departed, this tactic was used to great effect at the Battle of Dun Nechtain. When the Angles attacked they were drawn further and further north until the Picts finally drove their entire army into a loch. The Pictish kingdoms endured for several centuries before succumbing to devastating Viking raids and the growing power of the migrant Scots, who travelled from the north of Ireland during the 10th century AD.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_zodiac_archers_long	Born from a tradition of raiding nomadic tribesmen, mounted archery became firmly established in the ancient world, leading to some highly effective battlefield units. While foot archers could be equipped with longer, more powerful bows, the mounted archer was still a formidable opponent thanks to the design of the composite bow. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden variety. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina to use well, the composite bow demanded respect, care and attention. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_taifali_cavalry_long	Possibly an eastern Germanic or even Sarmatian people, the Taifali followed the Gothic king, Cniva, on his campaigns in Moesia and Dacia during the 3rd century AD. Coming into contact with the Roman Empire, they soon became famous for their excellent horsemen. Having been defeated by the Emperor Constantine, the Taifali continued to harass their oppressors until finally pacified around AD336. However, this did not lead to their automatic absorption into the Roman Empire, and those Taifali who chose not to resettle within its boundaries became self-governing allies of Rome. This may have been due to perceived difficulties in successfully governing such a harsh, mountainous region, or because the Romans needed a buffer against an increasing number of incursions by the marauding steppe nomads.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_archers_long	The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, they had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant they often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_onager_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_chosen_shields_long	Warrior societies in antiquity were, predictably, based very much on strength - the strongest man would become the leader, and only through remaining strong would he retain that position. Those around him, envious of his strength and desirous of his power, would work to undermine him whenever they saw the opportunity arise. To this end, the closest and most trusted and loyal of the chieftain's friends and companions acted as his bodyguards, fighting with him in battle and sharing in his victories and defeats. As the Middles Ages dawned, the dedication of these men to their kings was rewarded with titles, lands and power - such was the case with the thegns and huscarls of the later Saxon and Lombard kingdoms.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_posion_hunters_long	Warriors have been using bows to hunt and fight since before recorded history. Since at least early antiquity, arrows have been dipped into poison to better (and more duplicitously) kill the enemy. The addition of a venomous substance to an arrowtip increases its effectiveness as, even if the bowman does not strike a direct hit, a glancing blow that breaks the skin is all that is required for the toxin to get into an opponent's bloodstream. Although some the earliest evidence of poison arrows lies in Greek mythology, Alexander the Great spoke of enemy bowmen firing toxic arrows during his invasion of India in 326BC and there is also empirical evidence of poison-tipped bolts being used by the Gauls, Romans and Scythians.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_nordic_axe_warband_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_bre_armorican_cav	The westernmost tip of France, what we now call Brittany, was once known as Armorica, from the Gaulish phrase "are-mori" - "on the sea". It was an area of determined resistance to Roman rule throughout antiquity, and in the 5th century AD, as the Western Empire collapsed, migrating Britons were able to establish themselves in the region. These people, fiercely proud of their identity - having migrated to preserve it - provided a haven for those displaced by the collapse of Rome and the horrors of the migrating hordes. The Frankish Merovingian kings, in the late 7th century AD, created a line of fortresses and defences along the border with Armorica, known as the "Breton March". This and other marches were administered by wardens to the crown, who were charged with observing, guarding and defending the kingdom against potential incursion. Clearly, the Merovingians (and later the Frankish kings) found the presence of the Armorican Bretons a cause for vigilance.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_wolf_coats_long	Those warriors inspired by death and victory often wore the pelt of the wolf, looking as fierce as a pack of rabid beasts when they fell upon their enemies. For the defenders, the experience must have been even more frightening than battle usually was, and probably seemed almost supernatural to most men of the ancient world. The wolf is a recurring image in German and Norse mythology, often associated with Wodanaz or Odin, who was the god of victory, amongst other things. Also, three wolves are prominently featured in the Norse pantheon and figures dressed in wolf-pelts are often depicted in the art of the period, where images of warriors fighting wolves or bears abound.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_large_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_cheiroballistra_long	At close targets a 'ballista' could be aimed accurately, but at a cost in range; it could only fire around 500 metres. The machine used two torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, giving incredible power for its size. Firing either solid shot or bolts, it was equally effective against infantry or cavalry, but could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized 'oxybeles' composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_sword_heerbann_long	Amongst the Franks the term 'heerbann' was used to describe freemen called to bear arms for their country on a contractual basis, rather like the Anglo-Saxon 'fyrd' who came after them. Months prior to embarking on a military campaign the Franks mustered a heerbann, allowing time for them to equip, assemble and train for the conflict ahead. Ignoring a call to join could lead to harsh penalties, although heeding it also had its downsides, as many minor landowners struggled to afford their own armour and weapons. Although changed by the advent of the feudal system, the custom of calling a heerbann remained in place until around the time of the Crusades, gradually evolving into the Medieval French word 'arriere-ban'.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_elite_ballistarii_long	The Notitia Dignitatum lists many Legions under the title of 'ballistarii'. Whilst this translates simply as 'artillery', the existence of crossbow (then known as manuballistae) units in such large numbers, as recorded in the Notitia, indicates that balistarii referred to crossbow-armed foot soldiers, rather than full-size ballistae and their crews. Whilst many types were developed in ancient times, Roman crossbows bore similarities to later Medieval weapons, rather than being modelled on the Greek gastraphete. Operated by inserting the bolt and pulling it into place using a lever or crank, more torsion was created than a human could achieve without aid. The bolt, when released, fired with much more power than an arrow, and was therefore able to penetrate much thicker armour.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_savaran_cavalry_long	The Savaran were a wide-ranging cavalry division under the Sassanid Empire, fielding horsemen from light skirmishes and horseback archers to heavy cataphracts. They were generally drawn from nobility, with the highest posts marked for those from the House of Sassan, and those of Parthian descent. They used a variety of weapons; the Parthian spear being the most famous, but also lances, swords, maces and axes. Sassanid cavalry was born out of the need for a highly-mobile military force that could potentially fight a war on two fronts and make use of the eastern steppes, particularly against the infantry-heavy forces of the western powers of the age. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_mormaer_cavalry_long	Regional lords of the Scoti, the title ‘Mormaer’ was awarded to those individuals positioned directly beneath the king within the structure of Highland society. Although the subject of some debate, the word is thought to mean either ‘chieftain’, ‘Lord of the Seas’ or ‘Great Steward’. Whatever its etymology, Mormaer were specifically concerned with the defence of the Scottish coast from Nordic raids that started to occur after the Picts had been supplanted as the largest tribal group in the north of Britannia. As the centuries passed and the Dark Ages gave way to the Medieval era the word Mormaer became interchangeable with the more commonly-known ‘Thane’. Like most other nobles of the period, they fought as cavalry on the battlefield.	true

In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mis_nor	The skeid was one of the larger types of longship; primarily used as a warship, its name means ‘that which cuts through water’. Perhaps the most famous skeid discovered in recent times is the Roskilde 6, at 37 metres long it is the largest longship ever discovered. Twenty percent of the original timbers have survived and been painstakingly restored, while the rest of the ship is represented by a huge metal frame to give a sense of scale. The Roskilde 6 can be found, along with a number of other longboats discovered in the harbour, at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_kerns	Although the word ‘ceithern’ - pronounced ‘kern’ – simply refers to a group of fighters, they were one of two essential components of later Celtic Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, kerns were very much designed to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles kerns filled very much depended on the needs of their clan. Although their stock-in-trade was the execution of surprise skirmish attacks, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, kerns occasionally engaged in melee and could easily run down fleeing routers. On the battlefield kerns wore a light leather coat, rather than the heavy chainmail favoured by the gallowglasses, which ensured unrestricted movement. They also carried a variety of missiles, often sporting darts but also slings and javelins on occasion.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_matiarii_long	Matiarii were an infantry unit attached to the elite Palatina Legions, and so mostly served in the Emperor's personal army, fighting primarily with javelins. Perhaps most famously, matiarii were a part of the Imperial army that fought at the Battle of Adrianople, widely regarded as the catalyst for the terminal decline of the Western Roman Empire. The Emperor Valens supposedly took refuge with his matiarii as the Roman force collapsed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_palatina_long	'Auxilia palatina' were elite auxiliary troops that first emerged from the military reforms and expansion of Constantine the Great in AD325. Drafted from the local populace, auxiliaries often took the name of the tribe from which they were predominantly comprised, such as the Mattiaci and the Ampsivarii. The Notitia Dignitatum gives a fairly comprehensive list of units classified as auxilia palatina but does not give any direct reference to the strength of those troops. However, there is some confusion between auxilia and limitanei, who were specifically frontier troops. It can be assumed, therefore, that auxilia palatina were stationed in force behind the Empire's frontiers, in such places as Gaul, Iberia and Britannia.	true

From Philip of Macedon's Somatophylakes or the Roman Praetorian Guard to the Mongolian Kheshig or the Forbidden Troops of Tang Dynasty China, the very best military men have always defended their leaders. The proximity that royal guards had to their rulers often meant that the political power they wielded was amplified to the point that crises would often be determined by which side the royal defenders backed; if they stayed loyal, then the leadership often survived, but if they defected, the ruler would be supplanted in favour of a candidate of their choosing, if not one of their own.	true

As the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the Amazigh were thrown into disorder, but an opportunistic one.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_dismounted_warband_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_saxon_spears_long	Arguably the first time the 'Saxones' - an aggressive Germanic tribe - was mentioned was by the Egyptian writer Claudius Ptolemy in 'Geographia', during the 2nd century AD. At the time they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia. Over the ensuing years, they settled there in large numbers, eventually becoming known as the 'English' and the place, 'England'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_teulu	The 'teulu' were the personal bodyguard of the Welsh chieftains. They followed a tradition common in other Anglo-Saxon and Germanic societies of the time, whereby close companions and retainers to the lord or king fought alongside him in battle with unwavering loyalty and skill. In this way they are analogous to the hearth companions of the Saxons and the housecarls of the Danes and Anglo-Saxons. Teulu literally means 'family', which implies the close bond they shared with their lord. Riding into battle carrying spears and shields, clad in mail, they were in many ways much like early knights. On the battlefield they were visibly-similar, charging down their enemies with spear or lance in their lord's name.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_light_mel_eas	The dromonarion was smaller and lighter than the dromon and was ideal for patrolling the mouths of rivers. Following the Battle of Actium, where Augustus defeated Marc Anthony and Cleopatra to become First Citizen and de facto Emperor, the Roman navy favoured lighter, more manoeuvrable ships over the larger warships used by the Greeks. This was because of the types of duties they were expected to perform; tasks such as escorting the grain ships from Egypt, suppression of piracy, and river patrols. By this time, large ships were no longer required as there were few naval powers who remained large enough to pose a threat to the new Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_sagittarii_long	From the very beginnings of its Empire, during the time of the Principate, Rome had fielded 'sagittarii' - archers - drawn from its subject peoples as auxiliaries to the Legions. As the centuries wore on, following several sets of reforms, almost all of them were folded into the Roman army proper. In the Western Empire, archers were used in much smaller numbers than other classes of skirmisher, however, possibly due to the composite bows with which they fought; the glue used tended to dissolve in wet western climes and the wood would warp, rendering the weapon entirely useless. It was a much more common sight for units of sagittarii to be attached to Eastern Roman armies as cavalry, where they followed their region' ancient traditions of skirmishing from horseback.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gardingi_cavalry_long	The Visigoths, then known as the Thurungi, emerged from the Gothic confederation of tribes at around the end of the 4th century AD. Having defeating the Romans at Adrianople, they sacked Rome before moving into the west, eventually settling in France and Spain and becoming foederati of the Empire. Like many of the Migration Period peoples, the Ostrogoths were not a single tribe but rather a confederation of warrior bands united by a single leader. Perhaps the most famous of these was Alaric I, who was responsible for the sack of Rome in AD410. However, his relationship with the Romans was not at all straightforward. Having fought for them in the Balkans, Alaric was appointed Magister Militum for Illyria in AD397. This gave him control of the Illyrian arms factories or fabricae, making it likely that the forces that so successfully attacked Rome used Roman weapons to do it.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_ram_cel	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true

One tale suggests they are the children of the Djinn, seraphic servants of King Solomon who remained on earth after their lord's death. Another legend states that the Kurds were founded by Melik Kurdim, a follower of Noah, after the biblical flood. Whatever their origins, the Kurds were first noted as mercenary slingers for the Seleucid Empire and Parthia. They are not referred to as 'Kurds', however, until the time of the Sassanids, when the founder of the empire, Ardashir, battled the Kurds and their leader, Madig. Their loyalty was fluid; they provided military support for both Eastern Rome and the Sassanids throughout antiquity, depending on which power was in overall control of their homelands at the time.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_armoured_cav	The Umayyad military was a mixture of traditional Muslim warriors, descended from the Syrian garrisons in Al-Andalus, as well as local Andalusian converts to Islam and Berber people from Africa. Although the elite units were drawn from the Andalusian garrisons, the role of the caliph's personal guard - or 'hasham' - was reserved for the elite of the slave military class - the Mamluks. Right across the caliphate's territory, Mamluks formed the bulk of the armed forces, with status beyond that of a normal slave and even of a free citizen. As the centuries passed, the influence of the Mamluks continued to grow, they began occupying positions of increasing seniority in both the military and civilian administrations, eventually toppling their masters in Egypt during the 13th century to become the sultans of the Bahri dynasty.	true

As the barbarian kingdoms inhabited the cities and infrastructure of the old Roman Empire, they also used much of its military and civil administration, for the sake of practical convenience. This included some military structure; the comitatenses continued to be led by a 'comte', the root of the noble title ‘count’ - itself a Latinised version of 'companion' in reference to Alexander the Great's friends and compatriots. Vandali comitatus were professional soldiers with the skill-at-arms of Roman Legionaries. 	true

This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_gothic_pikemen	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true

The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the early Middle Ages, the Frankish navy was of no real distinction, yet Charlemagne did maintain a sizeable navy to defend against Viking raids, which was something other kingdoms generally failed to do.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_royal_horsemen	Cavalry was far-less prominent amongst Anglo-Saxon forces than in other nations of the early Middle Ages. Their ancestors, the forest-dwelling Germanic tribes of the continent, famously had access to very few horses compared to their Roman or steppe nomad opponents and, other than references to pack animals pulling transport goods and supplies and messengers, little evidence of their military use has been found. However, in later centuries, there appears to have been a determined attempt by successive Saxon kings to breed a stock of hardy warhorses. The Anglo-Saxon thegns were usually seen atop horses, although rarely did they ride during battle due to the long-held "barbarian" tradition of fighting on foot and in melee as the preferred, most honourable method of combat. The Church, furthermore, was heavily involved in the raising of royal cavalry during later centuries – a prime example being in AD875, when the Worcester diocese was made responsible for the breeding and care of horses for the Mercian king, Ceowulf.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_godansmen_long	Although thought spurious by the historian Paul the Deacon, the tale of the Winnili tribe is nevertheless the earliest account of the Langobard's connection with Godan (better known to us as Odin). When facing the Vandals, who entreated him for victory, the god told them that he would grant victory to the first army he saw on the day of battle. When the day came, Godan spotted the Winnili first, and asked "who are those long beards?" Following their victory, they became known as Langobards - literally 'Longbeards' - from that point on. In tribute, their 'wolf warriors' were impassioned by the 'dance' of Godan. Tribal elders imbued themselves with the spirit of the god in order to inspire younger warriors to feats of greatness in his name.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_heavy_tra_nor	A knarr was a merchant ship used for long sea voyages and built using an method where planks were laid overlapping one another, known as the 'clinker-built' or 'lapstrake' method. Deeper and shorter than a longship, the knarr's larger hull enabled merchants to carry up to 24 tons of cargo on a single voyage. These powerfully built ships often crossed the North Atlantic carrying livestock and other trade goods to Britain, Europe and as far east as Constantinople, where they traded thralls, or slaves, with Arab merchants in exchange for silver. Although many Viking tales talk of murder and looting, they eventually set up successful colonies, including a number in North America, modern-day Newfoundland, Labrador and Canada.	true

The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_elite_t'or_warriors_long	The spear has been around as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. In Africa and the eastern deserts, there were few changes to the spear's design over the ensuing millennia other than advances in metal work (iron replacing bronze tips). For instance, the most popular African spear type, still used by Zulu hunters, remains the ‘assegai’, which is intentionally light-weight so it can be either thrusted or thrown, depending on the situation its bearer finds himself in. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_burgundian_axemen_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Although most German warriors were armed with spears, use of the axe became commonplace within some bands due to its brutal effectiveness at cutting through armour, flesh and even bone.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_frankish_general_long	The Franks were originally a group of Germanic tribes, formed along the Rhine frontier, who, in the 3rd century AD, migrated westwards to settle in Gaul and as far south as northern Hispania. Although technically a barbarian incursion which they at first resisted, Rome eventually recognised the new Frankish kingdom in around AD357. In return, many Franks fought alongside the Roman army as foederati after that date. Observing the Franks, the Roman historian Sidonius Apollinaris spoke of a love of fighting bred into their young from an early age, stating "it is their sport to send axes hurling through the vast void and know beforehand where the blow will fall, to whirl their shields, to outstrip with leaps and bounds the spears they have hurled, and reach the enemy first".	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_royal_horsemen	Most armies of the early Middle Ages relied heavily on foot soldiers. This was due to the large number of low-status soldiers with little equipment of their own – certainly not horses – and little real training to speak of. In fact, cavalry-heavy forces were not generally part of the military fashion of the time until the development of the stirrup and the peaked saddle made them more attractive to the western powers. The stirrup increased the endurance, manoeuvrability and speed of the horse and reduced its rider's fatigue as the animal was easier to control; this, along with advances in armour technology, meant cavalry – now as heavy as the eastern cataphracts of antiquity - once again became a fixture on the battlefield.	true

In this capacity the tagmata put down several revolts in the eastern provinces. Membership of the tagmata was considered a method of social mobility, as it frequently gave an individual power; proximity to the Emperor meant his attention could be piqued, leading to a court appointment or military command.	true

Gone was the reliance on a backbone of columns and infantry; instead, the eastern empires fielded heavy cataphracts, drawn from the nobility, as their main strength. These powerful shock troops were complimented by horse or camel archers, to harry the enemy and keep them under pressure. On foot, the Persians fielded light spearmen levies supported by an elite division of archers to back the cavalry and rain death upon the enemy. Also, the cataphracts were often aided by the hammer-blow of the terrifying elephant corps, upon which great importance was placed due to its magnificent power.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_band_long	While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by the Romans. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle.	true

Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic troops, the lightly-armoured axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mel_ger	Snekkja are thought to be the smallest of all the Viking warships, carrying a relatively small crew of 41 men. The design of these ships varied slightly depending on the location of its construction; for example, the Norwegian design was better suited to Atlantic weather conditions and deep fjords, meaning it had more draft than its Danish counterparts, designed for shallow coastal waters and beaches. These lighter ships, so light that it is thought they could be carried short distances over-land between waterways, were the most common design of longship, often appearing in the Viking histories. It was reported that the great King Cnut even used 1200 of them to assert his claim over Norway in AD1028.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mel_cel	Literally meaning ‘long ship’ in the Gaelic language, the ‘long fhada’ can claim heritage from the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the Nordic peoples. Of course, the Norsemen didn’t just give their prized technology away, but their persistent raids of the Scottish and Irish coasts meant that longships were sometimes captured, enabling the Celts to study their construction in depth. Eventually, they produced the ‘birlinn’ and ‘Irish galley’, variants on the longship with between eight and twelve oars, in addition to a large sail. These features allowed the new breed of Celtic ships to easily cross the open sea for the purposes of trade and war, rather than having to remain close to the coastline at all times. Unfortunately, no remains of Celtic long fhada survive to this day, despite records of their continuous use until the 17th century.	true

Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty.

Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_alani_spearmen_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true

Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_axemen	Celtic warriors were ideally equipped to hack through even heavily-armoured foes. Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic troops, the lightly-armoured axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_cheiroballista	At close targets a 'ballista' could be aimed accurately, but at a cost in range; it could only fire around 500 metres. The machine used two torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, giving incredible power for its size. Firing either solid shot or bolts, it was equally effective against infantry or cavalry, but could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized 'oxybeles' composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_excubitores_cavalry_guard_long	Before the rule of Constantine the Great, the Emperor’s protection was vested to the Praetorian Guard. After an ill-fated rebellion, however, Constantine defeated the Praetorians, dissolved their order and appointed the Scholae Palatinae as his personal guard in their place. Yet even they found themselves relegated to little more than parade troops with little military backbone. The solution arrived In AD460, when Leo I inaugurated the ‘Excubitores’, or 'Sentinels', a small, elite military squad based at Constantinople. Such proximity to the Emperor meant that the Excubitores, and particularly their leader, became extremely important. In fact many future Emperors held that very post before being elevated to the highest office, as in the case of Justin I.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_tanukhid_pikes_long	A two-handed spear or pike, varying from four to seven metres in length, the sarissa became widely adopted in ancient armies. With an iron tip and a bronze butt-spike, which provided balance and could be dug into the ground to hold a charge, the pike was an effective weapon when used en masse. A tightly formed wall of pike-armed infantry presented an almost impenetrable barrier to other foot units and especially to cavalry, whose mounts would balk at the charge when faced with so many spearpoints. When advancing in close order against the enemy, each man occupied a square roughly 90cm to a side with the pike of the first five ranks projecting beyond. When defending they formed up even tighter, locking together with each man resting his shield on the man in front for greater stability. Such formations sacrificed manoeuvrability however, making their main weakness their flanks and rear.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_noble_steppe_cataphracts_long	The Sarmatians, a western group of steppe peoples, occupied the area north of the Black Sea, bordering Dacian and Germanic lands. They roamed this region as they pleased, and had a fierce reputation as cavalrymen almost without equal. They were feared by the Greeks, and often worked as mercenaries or allied themselves to the Dacians. The Sarmatians were always horse archers, but their cavalry gradually adopted heavier and heavier armour as the centuries passed, eventually wearing as much armour as the famed cataphracts of the east. Even the horses wore full suits of scale armour. The riders kept their fearsome bows, even as they became magnificent shock cavalry. With each man carrying a kontos, a long two-handed lance, they could smash through almost any enemy foolish enough to stand against them. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_scout_cavalry	Most armies of the early Middle Ages continued to rely heavily on foot soldiers. This was due to the large number of low-status soldiers with little equipment of their own – certainly not horses – and little real training to speak of. In fact, cavalry-heavy forces were not generally part of the military fashion of the time until the development of the stirrup and the peaked saddle made them more attractive to the western powers. The stirrup increased the endurance, manoeuvrability and speed of the horse and reduced its rider's fatigue as the animal was easier to control; this, along with advances in armour technology, meant cavalry – now as heavy as the eastern cataphracts of antiquity - once again became a fixture on the battlefield.	true

They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans.

In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_noble_acatziri_raiders_long	Thought to be of Thracian or Scythian descent, and believing themselves descended from Herakles himself, the warlike Agathyrsi, also known as Acatziri, lived on a plain that is now part of modern-day Romania from around 700BC. They were famous for their unusual, relaxed attitude to breeding - where everyone belonged to everyone else - which instilled a sense of brotherhood and common purpose within the tribe in order to prevent in-fighting. The Agathyrsi were also known for their fearsome appearance. Their blue hair and tattooed bodies were frightening on the battlefield and an unusual sight away from it; the amount of coverage indicating a warrior’s position within his tribe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_horse_whisperer_long	'Horse whispering' may seem an arcane, mysterious and perhaps even amusing practise, but it was nevertheless something that the Picts firmly believed in. Beginning as a specialised agricultural technique used by farmers to control their livestock, those who knew 'the word' were able to speak directly to a horse's soul by murmuring into its ear; if the word was true, the horse would respond accordingly - as man and horse have common ancestry in Celtic legend. In reality, the calming effect of whispering, along with body language and eye contact relaxes horses, making them far less likely to resist. Horse whispering was used in conjunction with aromatherapy to condition them to react to certain smells - such as halting or turning around when in contact with 'jading' scents, such as dead moles or spores. These control methods eventually took on a military aspect, as warriors laid jading scents in the path of enemy cavalry to interrupt charges or flanking actions.	true

These flexible, sparsely-clad infantry formed a large part of late Roman armies, acting primarily as a skirmishing force. They were used to harass the enemy and hurled slingshot, javelins and plumbatae - deadly lead darts - before falling back through the maniples of heavy infantry as they advanced. They could then continue skirmishing on the enemy's flanks. In this way, levis armaturae never gave the enemy pause to regroup or breathe; successful skirmishers maintained a defensive screen as an army manoeuvred, able to keep pressure on the enemy and an eye on their own flanks.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_berber_jinetes	The Berber people amalgamated into the Muslim forces after the Islamic conquest of Maghreb in the 7th and 8th centuries AD were fierce, stubborn, and not easily subjugated by their new masters. As a collection of tribes, Berbers brought great diversity and skill to the caliphate's army. Their cavalry was of particular note; the Berber being proficient cavalrymen who fielded lightly-armoured, mounted raiders atop excellent Arabian horses. The cavalrymen of the Zenata tribe became known as 'jinetes', who found that switching to horses from camels greatly improved their usefulness on the battlefield. As a result of the caliphate's relentless advance into the Iberian Peninsula, the north African natives soon found themselves fighting the Spanish, who later adapted the jinete cavalry model as they fought back against Islam during the Reconquista.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_axe_levy_long	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army, whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and a greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

After the fall of Western Rome, the rank remained in use within the barbarian kingdoms that followed. ‘Comes’ – the singular - is Latin for ‘companion’ and used here in direct reference to the companions of Alexander the Great, the most trusted lieutenants of the greatest military leader the ancient world had ever seen. Comites were  the leading officials amongst the ruler's inner circle, occupying a great variety of administrative and military offices. In the Roman Empire, this ranged from the ‘Comes Britanniarum’, who was in charge of Roman Britain’s defence, to the ‘Comes Sacrae Vestis’ – the vitally important master of the Emperor’s wardrobe!	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_sighthound_spears_long	Dogs have always been useful for guard, patrol and scout work. With skilled handlers they can also be used effectively on the battlefield. Attack dogs were specifically bred and trained to ignore the noise and chaos of combat. Taught to attack on command, they were starved a little to ensure aggression before being unleashed upon enemy formations as a savage wave. Faced with a pack of foaming, hungry dogs many men naturally broke or faltered, opening gaps in a battle line that could then be exploited by melee troops.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mis_cel	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mis_ger	The skeid was one of the larger types of longship; primarily used as a warship, its name means ‘that which cuts through water’. Perhaps the most famous skeid discovered in recent times is the Roskilde 6, at 37 metres long it is the largest longship ever discovered. Twenty percent of the original timbers have survived and been painstakingly restored, while the rest of the ship is represented by a huge metal frame to give a sense of scale. The Roskilde 6 can be found, along with a number of other longboats discovered in the harbour, at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark.	true

Following the Battle of Actium, where Augustus defeated Marc Anthony and Cleopatra to become First Citizen and de facto Emperor, the Roman navy favoured lighter, more manoeuvrable ships over the larger warships used by the Greeks. This was because of the types of duties they were expected to perform; tasks such as escorting the grain ships from Egypt, suppression of piracy, and river patrols. By this time, large ships were no longer required as there were few naval powers who remained large enough to pose a threat to the new Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_hurlers_long	Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_limitanei_borderguards_long	In the face of an increasing number of barbarian incursions, the effective defence of Rome’s now-sprawling territory became a serious problem in the 4th century AD. The Emperor Constantine’s controversial solution was to divide the army into two halves. 'Limitanei', literally ‘the men on the limes’ or 'borders', were frontier garrison troops intended to pin down an invading force until the full-time 'comitatenses', the late-Roman equivalent of the traditional Legionaries, could arrive to deal with the situation decisively. Although well-equipped, limitanei were generally considered by all to be second-class warriors. This was possibly because they were often part-time soldiers who had been encouraged to settle and farm the land around their outposts in exchange for policing the Empire's borders.	true

One such change was that many more elite troops - called 'tagma', meaning 'to set in order' in Greek - were kept as professional garrisons at the capital, Constantinople. The 'Numeroi' were one such unit. Also known as the 'Bathhouse Boys' for their chosen base of operations, they were charged with the defence of prisons, the palace, the vaunted 'invincible' walls of the city and, eponymously, the Baths of Zeuxippus. There was also a more clandestine sect among them, known as 'portatioi', who worked in the shadows as official Imperial torturers...	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_camel_warriors_long	Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly, and are generally less nervous. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. Also, when faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to back away from fights. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made controlling them considerably easier and conveyed another advantage; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick off targets with some ease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_palatina_guards_long	'Auxilia palatina' were elite auxiliary troops that first emerged from the military reforms and expansion of Constantine the Great in AD325. Drafted from the local populace, auxiliaries often took the name of the tribe from which they were predominantly comprised, such as the Mattiaci and the Ampsivarii. The Notitia Dignitatum gives a fairly comprehensive list of units classified as auxilia palatina but does not give any direct reference to the strength of those troops. However, there is some confusion between auxilia and limitanei, who were specifically frontier troops. It can be assumed, therefore, that auxilia palatina were stationed in force behind the Empire's frontiers, in such places as Gaul, Iberia and Britannia.	true

First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_fyrd_archers	Whilst archers had their place in the battle lines of Anglo-Saxon armies they were never used in large numbers, as traditional military values placed greater importance on melee infantry and the glory to be gained through hand-to-hand combat; for instance, only one archer is depicted amongst the English forces on the Bayeux Tapestry. Whilst a thegn may have been trained in how to use a bow as a hunting weapon, standard fyrdmen would not have had that advantage. Those who were, however, commonly used the longbow - which became more common across Europe during the early Middle Ages. Made of yew or ash, with bowstrings of looped and corded linen, longbows were superior to selfbows. British proponents of the longbow, mainly the English and Welsh, became renowned for their skill with the weapon in later centuries - the most famous example being the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, when English archers were key to the defeat of a supposedly-superior French army.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_wh_spet_xyon_archers_long	The White Huns, like their more famous namesakes, were masters of mounted archery tactics. Their contact with so many different empires across the world made them familiar with the best aspects of many different military traditions, and enabled them to use the best of those to their advantage. Tactics from the Sassanid Persians (such as the Parthian shot), the Gupta Empire (inventors of the steel bow) and the wild, lawless steppes combined to create some of the most devastating missile troops imaginable. The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee.	true

Numidan cavalry were a supremely agile force who skirmished with assured expertise, swinging around to escape as rapidly as they had arrived. They wore tunics only and carried javelins and small wicker shields.

When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies.

Within this structure, the ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank and one which carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on many aspects of government, not just military matters. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_javelinmen_long	The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young people aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for younger members to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mel_nor	Snekkja are thought to be the smallest of all the Viking warships, carrying a relatively small crew of 41 men. The design of these ships varied slightly depending on the location of its construction; for example, the Norwegian design was better suited to Atlantic weather conditions and deep fjords, meaning it had more draft than its Danish counterparts, designed for shallow coastal waters and beaches. These lighter ships, so light that it is thought they could be carried short distances over-land between waterways, were the most common design of longship, often appearing in the Viking histories. It was reported that the great King Cnut even used 1200 of them to assert his claim over Norway in AD1028.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_funditores_long	Rome liked to have the best of everything. When it came to skirmishers 'funditores', Latin for 'slingers', were recruited to accompany its Legions on campaign as early as the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC. The best slingers in the western Mediterranean came from the Balearic islands, where it is said that children had to 'sling for their dinners' - having to knock their bread from a wall at range before being permitted to eat by their parents. In the eastern Mediterranean, the rocky crags of islands such as Crete produced fine skirmishers, be they slingers, javelineers or archers. During Imperial Rome's almost constant wars against the eastern empires local skirmishers were drafted into fight, honouring the long-standing traditions of their inhospitable homelands and enabling the Romans to 'level the playing field' in terms of army structure and tactics.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_mel_rom	Liburnians were small, compact galleys, ideal for patrolling the Roman coastlines. They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans. During the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire came under continued attack from increasingly stronger barbarian forces from the north and east. In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ger_suebi	The Suebi were not a single tribe, but a collection of many smaller groupings sharing a language, gods, and an abiding interest in raiding their neighbours across the Rhine. This interest in warfare is important, however, as it is through warfare that Suebi warriors earned fame and notoriety. While kings and chiefs were often members of elite or ‘noble’ families, their positions were elected; success in war was a good way of attaining and keeping power within the tribes. This need for glory and to be seen doing mighty deeds might also explain the most distinctive feature of a Suebi’s appearance: his hair. To distinguish themselves from their slaves, Suebi freemen and warriors sported a topknot that added to their height and fearsome appearance. For kings, chiefs and champions, this ‘Suebian Knot’ was even more elaborate than usual. That way, the doer of great deeds would be clearly visible on the battlefield. 	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_ashum_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_elite_palatina_long	'Auxilia palatina' were elite auxiliary troops that first emerged from the military reforms and expansion of Constantine the Great in AD325. Drafted from the local populace, auxiliaries often took the name of the tribe from which they were predominantly comprised, such as the Mattiaci and the Ampsivarii. The Notitia Dignitatum gives a fairly comprehensive list of units classified as auxilia palatina but does not give any direct reference to the strength of those troops. However, there is some confusion between auxilia and limitanei, who were specifically frontier troops. It can be assumed, therefore, that auxilia palatina were stationed in force behind the Empire's frontiers, in such places as Gaul, Iberia and Britannia.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_dragonship	The drekkar or 'dragon ship' takes its name from the detailed carvings that decorated its prow. Adorned with dragons or snakes, it was designed to ward off the terrifying sea creatures that many people believed inhabited the dark places of the oceans - creatures like the kraken, a terrifying giant squid that could pull whole ships down to the depths, or the undead draugen. These reanimated corpses were men lost at sea that legend states appear during storms and on rough seas to sink boats.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_palatina_defectors_long	Punishment in the Roman Army was severe, even for minor crimes. An act of desertion - treason in the eyes of the Senate - brought with it even more brutal punishments, such as being placed in a sack filled with snakes and tossed into a river. Yet in spite of the oath they swore, Roman troops did desert their ranks and, in many cases, found their way into the employ of opposing armies. More often than not, these soldiers came from conquered Imperial territory, breaking away from an overlord they didn't believe in to fight for their homeland.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_spear	From the most inexperienced fighter to the most battle-hardened elite, the spear remained the cheapest, most accessible and therefore common weapon of the Carolingian era. Historically, the weapon of the lower classes, the spear eventually became more prominent amongst all classes of military society; an entire force of armoured spearmen assaulted the palace of Lateran in AD769, for example. Changes in the types of opponent led to development of weapons in order to defeat them. 'Lugs' - or wings - started to appear under the blade in order to hook and grab at armour and 'languets' - protrusions from the shaft itself - were added to protect the user, further evidence that the spear was used for prolonged, matched combat against heavily-armoured cavalry.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_spear	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_select_axemen	The 'fyrd' was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary farmers - 'freemen', in the parlance of the times, meaning those not tied to a lord as vassals. The infrequent but bloody struggles between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the early Middle Ages, and the Viking threat that followed, meant that the process of levying troops to fight was still necessary. If people are fighting for their very homes and livelihoods - not just a distant figurehead of a monarch - they tend to have a sense of purpose and urgency. Courage can come later, bolstered by massed ranks in the mean time, as can proficiency - there was rarely much time set aside for training amateurs before a battle. Originally, every able man was recruited to fight but this revealed a flaw in that if a war or struggle became protracted, or if too many people died, then there would be nobody to work the fields at its conclusion. To this end, the Anglo-Saxons developed what we now call the "select" system, where only those deemed most able would be chosen to join the fyrd. The remainder would stay at work, creating a surplus of provisions and equipment for both the marching army and those left behind in order to sustain the realm and improve the army's chances of victory. In practice, the majority of men were not levied, so many were expected to service the war machine in other practical ways. The fyrd were called upon on many occasions during the years of the Viking invasions, most famously to fight the Norwegian king Harold Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, just weeks before the cataclysmic Saxon defeat at Hastings.	true

Following the Battle of Actium, where Augustus defeated Marc Anthony and Cleopatra to become First Citizen and de facto Emperor, the Roman navy favoured lighter, more manoeuvrable ships over the larger warships used by the Greeks. This was because of the types of duties they were expected to perform; tasks such as escorting the grain ships from Egypt, suppression of piracy, and river patrols. By this time, large ships were no longer required as there were few naval powers who remained large enough to pose a threat to the new Roman Empire.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_heavy_tra_ger	A knarr was a merchant ship used for long sea voyages and built using an method where planks were laid overlapping one another, known as the 'clinker-built' or 'lapstrake' method. Deeper and shorter than a longship, the knarr's larger hull enabled merchants to carry up to 24 tons of cargo on a single voyage. These powerfully built ships often crossed the North Atlantic carrying livestock and other trade goods to Britain, Europe and as far east as Constantinople, where they traded thralls, or slaves, with Arab merchants in exchange for silver. Although many Viking tales talk of murder and looting, they eventually set up successful colonies, including a number in North America, modern-day Newfoundland, Labrador and Canada.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_levy_archers	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_hurlers_long	The young people of the Germanic tribes grew up throwing the stones found on the river beds of northern Europe, giving them a natural advantage when applying the skill to combat. Rocks and stones were in ready supply so, whilst spears may have needed repair after a battle, slingers were always well provisioned. Poor people of low status, both in society and subsequently in battle, they would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, protecting them from enemy attacks. In return, the veterans would use their shields to safeguard those behind them as they unleashed their rain of missiles. Slingshot could be an effective weapon against close enemy formations or cavalry.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_heavy_tra_cel	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where ships could go. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_sarmatian_spears_long	The Sarmatians were a steppe people, possibly of Iranian origin, who, following the migrations of the 4th century AD, dwelled along the Danube frontier. Their skill in horsemanship was highly developed, some even crediting them with the invention of the metal stirrup and spur. Today, our knowledge of the Sarmatians is largely due to their burial customs. The Kuban region of southern Russia contains some of the most elaborate Sarmatian tombs, and finds often included a fine array of weapons, metalwork and jewellery that provide a great deal of information about their day to day lives. Full suits of cataphract-style scale armour made for women indicate that female Sarmatians were just as deadly as their male counterparts; it is thought that unmarried women were allowed to ride into battle alongside the men, possibly giving rise to the Greek myth of the Amazons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_amazon_outriders_long	Many myths surround the Amazons, a legendary tribe of hunters and warrior-women, such as the story of Queen Hippolyta's magical girdle sought by Herakles. A female-dominated society, supposedly descended from Ares, they were reputed to have lived on the shores of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus, the Amazons were killers of men and a popular source of artistic and poetic inspiration within Greek culture. When necessary, they intermingled with the all-male Gargareans to keep up their numbers, or enslaved the few men they needed after raids or battles. Depicted as superb archers, the Amazons are also often shown carrying spears, axes and crescent-shaped shields. Archaeology suggests Sarmatian and Scythian women participated in battle, which may be the source of the Amazons’ legend.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_ambushers_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true

They were so named for always numbering exactly ten thousand - if any man died or fell ill, he was immediately replaced; in this way the unit never 'died' - it was immortal. They fought famously at the Battle of Thermopylae, flanking the redoubtable Spartans and ultimately securing victory. Although disappearing with the Archaemenids, the Immortals were revived under the Sassanids as an elite corps of honour guards, with the finest armour and weapons of their entire military, and adorned in fine livery to demonstrate their prestige.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_burgundian_mounted_axemen_long	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_berserkers_long	Howling like animals and biting their shields, berserkers took on the appearance of wild animals, entering battle in an almost trance-like state. Worked into a rage before combat, possibly through the use of drugs, they had little protection but were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade and indeed any blow that came their way. At the time, berserkers were thought to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria. However, their intended victims did not have the luxury of considering the opponent that stood before them; berserkers fought with a reckless fury, making them very uncompromising opponents to face, and to slay a berserker was thought a most impressive act of courage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_equites_promoti_long	Since Rome's beginnings, as was common in almost all ancient societies, the noble class were the only people who could afford horses, and were therefore most likely to own one. As a result, early Roman armies fielded cavalry consisting entirely of nobles - the equestrian class - and then bolstered their comparatively small numbers with units formed from the city's Italian Socii allies. Due to a number of high profile defeats, such as their poor showing during Hannibal's climactic Italian campaign at the end of the 3rd century BC, Roman cavalry contingents were generally considered to be far weaker than their Italian counterparts whilst purely a unit of nobles. Eventually the Socii were granted Roman citizenship and, following a number of reforms to the army's structure, were folded into its ranks. Wherever the Romans went after that they drew on local specialists to swell their numbers as auxiliary troops. By the time of the Hunnic incursions, auxiliaries had been made a part of the Legions, resulting in Rome being able to field some of the best, most adaptable cavalry in the ancient world.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_spike_ram_cel	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_large_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_alani_cavalry_warriors_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true

The people who lived there travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_camel_clibanarii_long	Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly, and are generally less nervous. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. Also, when faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to back away from fights. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made controlling them considerably easier and conveyed another advantage; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick off targets with some ease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_van_vandal	Originally thought to be from Scandinavia, and settling in Poland during the 2nd century BC, the Vandals were a confederation of Germanic tribes who went on to successfully migrate down through Europe and into Africa, forming a kingdom there in AD439. They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true

The Andalusians bred war horses of their own, a renowned breed now known as "Pure Spanish", from as far back as 450BC. Despite this prodigious equine legacy, however, Umayyad cavalry lagged behind the rest of the caliphate's highly-developed military machine; the stirrup and 'framed' saddle failed to catch on, despite being used widely in its eastern territories. Conversely, Iberian Muslims used the 'curb' bit - which provided better control over the horses - centuries before anyone else.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_scholae_palatinae_long	When a Roman Emperor went just about anywhere, he took his Scholae - the palace guard - with him. Essentially the successors of the corrupt, abolished Praetorians, the Scholae operated outside of the Legions' control, answering instead to the Magister Officorum, one of the senior civil offices of the late Roman state. Commanded in the field by the Emperor himself, Scholae were always recruited from non-Roman citizens. Presumably this was similar to the Ptolemaic Pharaohs' hiring of Galatian Celts as their bodyguards or many future Byzantine Emperors' use of Nordic warriors - the Varangian Guard - to protect them; someone who isn't a citizen, but is on the payroll, is less likely to revolt or engage in subterfuge against the throne. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_cav	Like other former barbarian kingdoms, the Franks inherited much of the Roman Empire's military and societal structure, not just its territory. Once again, cavalry was an aristocratic division as only wealthy landowners could afford horses and therefore provide cavalry during times of war. Elite cavalry, by extension, was drawn only from the most highly-skilled among them. They, more than any other, could afford not only the horse, but the mail and plate armour required; 'brunia' body armour was the single most expensive piece of military equipment of the age, costing more than the horse itself. Some took this to excess, adorning their armour with jewels and other finery, but Charlemagne was known to have criticised his noblemen for such ostentatious displays. In battle, Carolingian cavalry favoured a mass charge of spears to break the enemy quickly. This worked particularly well on favourable, flat terrain but led to problems on less-than-ideal topography. In fact, cavalry was still considered inferior until long after the Battle of Tours when, due to a failure in mobilisation, Charles Martel won the battle without any heavy horse at all. Standard Frankish horsemen were lightly armoured (wearing little more than padded cloth), carried spears and shields, and were best-suited for bringing home a cavalry charge and then, once involved in the fray, remaining to press the attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_fyrd_axemen	The 'fyrd' was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary farmers - 'freemen', in the parlance of the times, meaning those not tied to a lord as vassals. The infrequent but bloody struggles between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the early Middle Ages, and the Viking threat that followed, meant that the process of levying troops to fight was still necessary. If people are fighting for their very homes and livelihoods - not just a distant figurehead of a monarch - they tend to have a sense of purpose and urgency. Courage can come later, bolstered by massed ranks in the mean time, as can proficiency - there was rarely much time set aside for training amateurs before a battle. Originally, every able man was recruited to fight but this revealed a flaw in that if a war or struggle became protracted, or if too many people died, then there would be nobody to work the fields at its conclusion. To this end, the Anglo-Saxons developed what we now call the "select" system, where only those deemed most able would be chosen to join the fyrd. The remainder would stay at work, creating a surplus of provisions and equipment for both the marching army and those left behind in order to sustain the realm and improve the army's chances of victory. In practice, the majority of men were not levied, so many were expected to service the war machine in other practical ways. The fyrd were called upon on many occasions during the years of the Viking invasions, most famously to fight the Norwegian king Harold Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, just weeks before the cataclysmic Saxon defeat at Hastings.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_armoured_sword	The difficulty of obtaining iron in the early Middle Ages, combined with a lack of understanding of how to mass-produce welded weaponry meant that iron-forged blades were the weapons of noblemen who could afford the otherwise-prohibitive cost. Blades in the early Middle Ages were created through a process known as 'pattern welding', where iron rods, twisted together and ground down, formed a soft, carbonised centre for the blade that helped it better absorb the shock of a blow. Around this core, thin iron plates were then 'carburized' (hardened, essentially) onto the blade to give it increased strength. This style of layering metal pieces over each other gave blades a distinctive banding pattern, similar in appearance to the age-rings of a tree trunk.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_spear	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_dailamite_warriors_long	The Dailamites were people of the mountains. Although it has been suggested that they originated nearer the Tigris River in Anatolia, they nevertheless made their home in the Alborz, a mountain range to the north of what is now modern-day Iran. Known for their fierceness, Dailamite men were employed by the Sassanid Empire as high-quality infantry during the wars of late antiquity. At the end of this period, when the Rashidun Caliphate swept through the east, the stalwart Dailamites successfully resisted the Arab conquest from the Alborz, becoming known as the Muslims’ most perfidious enemy. It was not until the rise of the Seljuk Turks in the 11th century that the indomitable strength of the Dailamites finally began to wane.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_iberian_cav	The Iberian Peninsula was wealthy in many resources - iron and silver were natural minerals found in abundance there, but the region was also famous for breeding war horses at a time when cavalry warfare was becoming more popular once again. Islamic forces were augmented with highly-proficient Berber cavalry, whilst to the north the Franks under Charlemagne were fielding heavy, armoured riders in the style of the eastern cataphracts. The Frankish knights saw themselves as the right-hand of both their king and God, and fought with a brutal fervour to match the religious ideals of their Muslim enemies. The Asturians attempted to emulate Frankish ideals in this matter, fielding their own mounted knights to combat the Caliphate's growing army and return Spain to Christian hands.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_alani_warriors_long	Alani warriors were known to be strong and fierce - the Roman historian Marcellinus spoke of them in complimentary terms, calling them "men of great stature and beauty" with "terribly fierce" eyes. Their hardiness and determination is hardly surprising, given their lives on the harsh, eastern steppes, and then coping with upheaval and migration westward brought on by the appearance of the Huns. The Alans, Sarmatians and indeed all the nomadic tribes had no choice but to master this unforgiving life, be destroyed or consumed by a stronger people. The fierceness of Alani warriors was demonstrated at the Battle of Adrianople in AD378, when a Gothic and Vandal army, bolstered by Alani infantry, outflanked and destroyed Roman forces under Emperor Valens. With the Alani infantry engaged at their front, and Gothic cavalry surrounding them, the Romans were decisively defeated. Abandoned by his bodyguards, Valens' body was never found.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_savaran_sardar_long	The Savaran were a wide-ranging cavalry division under the Sassanid Empire, fielding horsemen from light skirmishes and horseback archers to heavy cataphracts. They were generally drawn from nobility, with the highest posts marked for those from the House of Sassan, and those of Parthian descent. They used a variety of weapons; the Parthian spear being the most famous, but also lances, swords, maces and axes. Sassanid cavalry was born out of the need for a highly-mobile military force that could potentially fight a war on two fronts and make use of the eastern steppes, particularly against the infantry-heavy forces of the western powers of the age. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_horse_masters	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. People of nomadic origin, such as the Sarmatians, Huns and Avars, were renowned as skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_armoured_sword	Originally a rare weapon of quite some prestige, the sword became more common in the early Middle Ages, with blades produced on a larger scale to more standardised specifications. The spatha of the Roman period became the basis of Viking and Carolingian longswords. These single-handed blades, with triangular pommels and short grips, were widely used, not only by the Viking Danes but right across Europe. Swords during the era were chiefly produced by the Franks and obtained by the Danes through either trade or, as is more likely, raiding, pillaging and looting of Frankish possessions. Although they were all of a roughly similar length, there were variances of several inches as, although they were more speedily produced, mass-production of arms and armour, and the standardisation and quality control that went with it, was still a rarity at that time.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_slav_skirm	Until very recently, when mechanisation reduced the amount of close-quarters fighting required, skirmishers were used to harass, never giving the enemy pause to regroup and distracting them until melee troops or cavalry could pin them down. In the ancient world, particularly among the 'civilised' states of the Mediterranean, many skirmishers were considered highly skilled, with places such as Crete and the Balearic Islands specialising in producing first class archers, slingers and javelineers. In the north and west of Europe, such weapons were generally thought considered cowardly - only fighting hand-to-hand in melee carried the required amount of honour and glory with it. As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blinded to an infantry or cavalry charge bearing down upon them.	true

During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight. The distinction, then, in antiquity, between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_lancers_long	Developed from the cavalry skills of their ancestors, steppe lancers were a type of heavy cavalry. They wore scale armour to protect themselves and their mounts, and used a long lance known as a kontos, which enabled them to deliver devastating charges in a fashion comparable to the deadly cataphract cavalry from the east. Their scale armour was made from horn, or later metal, and allowed its wearers to easily run down their western counterparts. However, lancers were still vulnerable to dense pike or spear-armed formations. Archery provided a solution: sustained volleys from skirmishing foot and horse archers were used to thin and spread out the enemy prior to a devastating, thunderous charge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_raiders_long	Although mounted troops are terrifying and effective as shock cavalry, charging down enemy lines and wreaking havoc, they also performed another, equally important function on the battlefield. Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horsemen were excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen for the main force, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks. More nimble melee cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreating before the enemy could effectively counter-attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_spearmen_long	While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by the Romans. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_arabic_horsemen_long	The term 'Arab' was first applied to the defeated forces of 'The Twelve Kings' at the Battle of Qarqar in AD853, as well as to related terms littered throughout the Hebrew Bible. Before the rise of Islam, the Arabs of late antiquity were multiplicitous, established mostly around what is now modern-day Yemen. The Himyarite Kingdom - known as Homerites by Romans and Greeks - was the most potent of the Arabian kingdoms, having conquered their surrounding lands and grown wealthy from trade with the Roman Empire. The Himyarites flourished from the 1st to the 6th century AD, when they were conquered by invading Christians from Aksum. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_spearmen_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_thrall_spearmen_long	Thralls were the slaves taken by the Nordic peoples as they raided the coastlines of northern Europe. As a result, most were captured from the coast of Britannia or on the Vikings' forays down the Volga River, where they became known as ‘Slavs’. The men who captured the thralls were known to the Mediterranean peoples as the ‘Rus’ – whose land eventually became Russia - or the ‘Varangians’, who of course served as unbiased Imperial bodyguards in the Byzantine Empire that succeeded the Eastern Romans. The lowest of the low in Nordic society, thralls were pressed into fighting and were often poorly-armed and armoured – the idea behind their use being that they would increase a Nordic army’s size until its opponents were overwhelmed by superior numbers, rather than their skill at arms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_spearmen_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces. Brought up on the traditions of feasting and raiding, they craved the opportunity to prove themselves against a worthy enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_warlord_long	The desert is a harsh and unforgiving place, yet it is home to many all the same. The people who lived there travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_hurlers_long	The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young people aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for younger members to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_wh_khingilas_khandas_long	Khingila was one of the first great rulers of the Hephthalites, blazing a trail across the western Empires. His name shares a root with the word for sword, underlining the importance of his military campaigns. During his reign, the White Huns came into extensive contact with the Gupta emperor, as demonstrated by the Indian-influenced coins minted at the time. However, more significantly for the power of the White Huns, this period also saw the adoption of Indian weapons. Two such examples are the khanda - the famous Sikh sword - and the fenestrated axe, which came into use further via trade connections along the Silk Route. The khanda has a blunt point but an extremely sharp blade, being designed to slash rather than stab like the Roman gladius. The fenestrated axe has apertures on the blade, thought to increase streamlining as it cuts through the air. It is easy to see why both caught on outside India - they could pierce most common types of armour more effectively than a sword or spear. As a result, well-preserved examples have been found in graves right across the western world.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_longship_transport	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where ships could go. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true

Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_levy_archers	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_warriors_long	These nomadic tribespeople come from the vast steppes to the north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and were known variously as Scythians or Saka, and later the western Sarmatians. Light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide. Such shields could also be scaled with either horn or metal. This type of armour also extended to their clothing at times, with scaled versions of their tunics becoming widespread, especially amongst the steppe nobility. These troops also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting their foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_onager_bastion_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_hunters_long	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_currach	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_raiders_long	Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_agathyrsi_warriors_long	Thought to be of Thracian or Scythian descent, and believing themselves descended from Herakles himself, the warlike Agathyrsi, also known as Acatziri, lived on a plain that is now part of modern-day Romania from around 700BC. They were famous for their unusual, relaxed attitude to breeding - where everyone belonged to everyone else - which instilled a sense of brotherhood and common purpose within the tribe in order to prevent in-fighting. The Agathyrsi were also known for their fearsome appearance. Their blue hair and tattooed bodies were frightening on the battlefield and an unusual sight away from it; the amount of coverage indicating a warrior’s position within his tribe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_warlords_companions	The Scandinavian housecarls or huscarls were professional, trained soldiers in service to a lord or king - the word literally meaning 'household man' or, more crudely put, 'manservant'. They were retainers to their lord or king - his personal bodyguard who fought close to and protected him on the battlefield in the same way as the 'hearth friends' of old Celtic and Germanic 'barbarian' Europe. Relics of the time now unearthed, such as the Turinge Stone, carry inscriptions calling these men the "best in the land", again reinforcing their elite status. Following the conquest of much of central and northern England by the Danes during the 10th century, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies. As such, they famously defeated their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and held the line at Hastings, protecting King Harold's body to the very last man.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_dune_lancers_long	The eastern nations eschewed columns of infantry in favour of a dominant cavalry force able to outmanoeuvre and harass infantry on their native plains. Therefore, in the name of variety, eastern cavalry took many forms. As a result short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers were all used, but the primary, most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could even skewer two men at once.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_grivpanvar_cataphracts_long	Grivpanvar, from the Middle Persian term for 'neck guard', were elite units that originated in the late Parthian Empire, but were fully adopted by the Sassanids. They were similar in many ways to the cataphracts - both horse and rider were heavily armoured and used as shock troops, smashing through enemy lines to soften forces for the rest to exploit. The Grivpanvar employed the Kontos; a long, wooden cavalry lance. Heliodorus claimed that the strength of the charge, combined with the length and weight of the spear, could impale two men at once.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_noble_germanic_horsemen_long	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_scouts_long	The Persian war machine differed greatly from that of the west. Gone was the reliance on a backbone of columns and infantry; instead, the eastern empires fielded heavy cataphracts, drawn from the nobility, as their main strength. These powerful shock troops were complimented by horse or camel archers, to harry the enemy and keep them under pressure. On foot, the Persians fielded light spearmen levies supported by an elite division of archers to back the cavalry and rain death upon the enemy. Also, the cataphracts were often aided by the hammer-blow of the terrifying elephant corps, upon which great importance was placed due to its magnificent power.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_scholae_gentiles_long	When a Roman Emperor went just about anywhere, he took his Scholae - the palace guard - with him. Essentially the successors of the corrupt, abolished Praetorians, the Scholae operated outside of the Legions' control, answering instead to the Magister Officorum, one of the senior civil offices of the late Roman state. Commanded in the field by the Emperor himself, Scholae were always recruited from non-Roman citizens. Presumably this was similar to the Ptolemaic Pharaohs' hiring of Galatian Celts as their bodyguards or many future Byzantine Emperors' use of Nordic warriors - the Varangian Guard - to protect them; someone who isn't a citizen, but is on the payroll, is less likely to revolt or engage in subterfuge against the throne. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_heroic_cavalry_long	Two tribal groups dominate the history of Scotland in ancient times. The Picts lived in northern and eastern Britannia, and successfully drove away all attempts to take the fertile lowlands of their homeland for hundreds of years. The Scoti was the collective term used to describe the tribes that sailed from Hibernia, modern-day Ireland, to raid the northern coasts of Roman Britain. By the end of the 5th century they had gained a foothold over the Pictish kingdoms, forming the territory of Dal Riata on the west coast of what is now Scotland. From AD360 onwards they are thought to have taken part in the so-called 'great conspiracy' of barbarians, a continual harassment of Rome's northern outposts that lasted until the withdrawal of the Legions in AD412. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_pikemen_long	Once use of the pike in battle had spread to the west, it was adopted by many of the barbarian tribes. As an extension of the popular 'shield wall' formation, emergent barbarian pike tactics had similarities to the phalanx combat of the Greek city-states and the Macedonian pike reforms that won half the world for Alexander the Great. However, tribal pike troops fought far more defensively than the Greeks, especially with the advent of heavy cavalry such as lancers and their supplanting of the more traditional barbarian infantry charge with brutal shock tactics. Gradually, pikes became a popular defensive choice all over northern Europe; the Norsemen used them in a similar, circular formation of around 1,000 men in a tightly-packed mass, designed to stop enemy cavalry charges dead in their tracks. This also likely gave rise to the later ‘schiltron’ or ‘shield troop’ formation commonly used by Scottish medieval armies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_artillery_dromont	The word 'dromont' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes. At the very minimum a dromon had a crew of 200; 50 men to the lower bank of oars, 100 on the oars above, and 50 combat marines. It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram. Some were reported to carry pipe-like weapons used to project Greek Fire onto enemy ships.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_horse_cutters_long	Unconventional tactics often led to victory through their ingenuity and the resultant confusion they cause among the enemy, and there are few as unconventional as horse hewing. First noted as swift 'runners' who backed up charioteers during the Bronze Age in Pharaonic Egypt. The first account of "horse-stabbing" is by Caesar during his Gallic conquests. Caesar recounts the effectiveness of the enemy, who broke his horsemen and terrified their steeds. He was so impressed that, upon their defeat, he drafted horse hewers into his army and used them in future campaigns. Horse-stabbers (or 'hewers' as they are sometimes called) were also depicted on coins throughout late antiquity, particulary on pagan iconography. Several tribes also made fully-fledged military divisions of horse-stabbers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_andalusian_infantry	Men who signed up to fight in the Andalusian armies of the Umayyad Caliphate were usually motivated by their religious beliefs, as was generally the case right across the burgeoning Islamic empire. Spain was an extremely wealthy territory due to its iron and silver resources. These seams, mined by both Carthage and Rome in centuries past, were reopened by the Umayyads, who then used the resultant wealth to import well-made weapons and armour from across Europe as well as creating their own. Less is known about Andalusian infantry than their cavalry, save that they represented the bulk of Umayyad armies in the region at a time when its cavalry was considered inferior and insufficient for purpose compared to that of their western European rivals.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_berber_levy	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_salian_frankish_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_amazon_cavalry_long	Many myths surround the Amazons, a legendary tribe of hunters and warrior-women, such as the story of Queen Hippolyta's magical girdle sought by Herakles. A female-dominated society, supposedly descended from Ares, they were reputed to have lived on the shores of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus, the Amazons were killers of men and a popular source of artistic and poetic inspiration within Greek culture. When necessary, they intermingled with the all-male Gargareans to keep up their numbers, or enslaved the few men they needed after raids or battles. Depicted as superb archers, the Amazons are also often shown carrying spears, axes and crescent-shaped shields. Archaeology suggests Sarmatian and Scythian women participated in battle, which may be the source of the Amazons’ legend.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_archers_long	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_scirii_warriors_long	The Scirii made several appearances in histories chronicling barbarian movements between the 2nd century BC and the 5th century AD. Etymologically speaking, they were probably Scandinavian in origin; they were referred to as ‘Scanians’ during the Gothic Wars of AD238 – 512 and the Goths’ name for themselves, ‘Gothiskandzas’, gives further credence to this theory. In fact, the Scirii may actually have been one of two early Gothic tribal groups from the Baltic coastal regions, specifically parts of modern-day Poland, before their initial migration around 200BC. By the time of the Hunnic incursions into southeastern Europe the Scirii had settled a territory around the Carpathian mountain range, having made peace with the Romans who dominated the region some centuries earlier. Following their defeat by Attila’s hordes, the Scirii sensibly allied themselves with the Huns, various factions eventually joining back up with Gothic confederations after the collapse of the Hunnic Empire. Due to their final geographical location, many Scirii later became Roman foederati. Indeed Odoacer, the first king of Italy following the Western Roman Empire’s collapse, was known to be of Scirii descent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_pictish_axemen_long	Celtic warriors were ideally equipped to hack through even heavily-armoured foes. Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic troops, the lightly-armoured axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_long_fhada	Literally meaning ‘long ship’ or 'long boat' in the Gaelic language, the ‘long fhada’ can claim heritage from the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the Nordic peoples. Of course, the Norsemen didn’t just give their prized technology away, but their persistent raids of the Scottish,  Irish and Welsh coasts meant that longships were sometimes captured, enabling the Celts to study their construction in depth. Eventually, they produced the ‘birlinn’ and ‘Irish galley’, variants on the longship with between eight and twelve oars, in addition to a large sail. These features allowed the new breed of Celtic ships to easily cross the open sea for the purposes of trade and war, rather than having to remain close to the coastline at all times. Unfortunately, no remains of Celtic long boats/long fhada survive to this day, despite records of their continuous use until the 17th century.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_palace_guard	The Carolingians ascended to power when Pepin the Young overthrew the Merovingian dynasty and was crowned king. Before that, his family were the Mayors of the Palace of Austrasia - on paper they were merely the managers of the royal household, but actually the real power behind the throne. Following the Merovingians’ deposition, the palace remained the hub of Carolingian power, with its guards essentially becoming the king's bodyguards. The palace guards' role was much similar to that of the Praetorians and Scholae Palatinae of the Roman Empire; veteran, elite infantry under direct royal control who would fight to the last in defence of their lord. The modern German region of Pfalz, also known as Rhineland-Palatinate, draws its name from these stalwart royal defenders.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_warlord_long	Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_berserkers_long	Originally thought to be from Scandinavia, and settling in Poland during the 2nd century BC, the Vandals were a confederation of Germanic tribes who went on to successfully migrate down through Europe and into Africa, forming a kingdom there in AD439. They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_mounted_raiders_long	The group of Norsemen who became known as ‘Vikings’ referred specifically to the seafarers who raided those lands bordering the North Sea, particularly the sparsely-defended Britannic coasts. Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_sarmatian_mounted_skirmishers_long	Nomadic melee or shock cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreated before the enemy could effectively counter-attack. Although mounted troops were terrifying and effective as shock cavalry, charging down enemy lines and wreaking havoc, they also performed another, equally important function on the battlefield. Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horsemen made excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen for their main hosts, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gothic_general_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_ballistarii	The Notitia Dignitatum lists many Legions under the title of 'ballistarii'. Whilst this translates simply as 'artillery', the existence of crossbow (then known as manuballistae) units in such large numbers, as recorded in the Notitia, indicates that balistarii referred to crossbow-armed foot soldiers, rather than full-size ballistae and their crews. Whilst many types were developed in ancient times, Roman crossbows bore similarities to later Medieval weapons, rather than being modelled on the Greek gastraphete. Operated by inserting the bolt and pulling it into place using a lever or crank, more torsion was created than a human could achieve without aid. The bolt, when released, fired with much more power than an arrow, and was therefore able to penetrate much thicker armour.	true

Originating in Yemen, on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, they settled and ruled from Al-Hira, in what eventually became central Iraq. Al-Hira was said to be a paradise on earth, but more importantly was a Sassanid asset outside of Arabia. As Sassanid clients, they rendered military service to their overlords, as well as taking a political role - even helping the Emperor Bahram V seize the throne in AD420. The Lakhmids also fought against the Eastern Romans throughout the 4th century alongside the Sassanids, who offered religious tolerance and freedom from Roman Orthodox Christianity.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_spearmen_long	These nomadic tribespeople come from the vast steppes to the north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and were known variously as Scythians or Saka, and later the western Sarmatians. Light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide. Such shields could also be scaled with either horn or metal. This type of armour also extended to their clothing at times, with scaled versions of their tunics becoming widespread, especially amongst the steppe nobility. These troops also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting their foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one.	true

Naturally, with such an auspicious start, Cú Chulainn goes on to become a legendary figure in his own right. It is notable that the Celtic martial arts were usually taught by women, some believing that the teachers were also priestesses, and that they conferred additional powers to their chosen students when in battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_noble_sword	Originally a rare weapon of quite some prestige, the sword became more common in the early Middle Ages, with blades produced on a larger scale to more standardised specifications. The spatha of the Roman period became the basis of Viking and Carolingian longswords. These single-handed blades, with triangular pommels and short grips, were widely used, not only by the Viking Danes but right across Europe. Swords during the era were chiefly produced by the Franks and obtained by the Danes through either trade or, as is more likely, raiding, pillaging and looting of Frankish possessions. Although they were all of a roughly similar length, there were variances of several inches as, although they were more speedily produced, mass-production of arms and armour, and the standardisation and quality control that went with it, was still a rarity at that time.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_armoured_indian_elephants_long	War elephants had to be trained like men and cavalry horses to endure the noise and chaos of battle. Indian war elephants were larger than their African counterparts and strong enough to carry a 'howdah', or small wooden tower, on their backs. The driver sat astride the beast’s neck while two men, armed with javelins, were in the howdah. Indian elephants first came to the Middle East when Seleucus, one of Alexander the Great’s Successors, invaded India in 305BC. As part of the peace treaty between the Seleucid dynasty and the Indian Mauryans, 500 war elephants came to the Seleucids.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_peruns_champions_long	During the 1st century AD, the eastern Slavs worshipped a pantheon of five gods known as the 'Quintheism'. These gods held dominion over different aspects of the world (the sun, the sky, the earth etc.). At the head of this pantheon was Perun, a thunder god who wielded an enormous axe (or sometimes a hammer) that returned to his hand when summoned. It is clear that Perun shares similarities with the thunder god Zeus, head of the classical Greek pantheon, as well as Thor and his hammer Mjolnir. Perun was above all other gods - the Slavs declared him the "creator of lightning" and "the only lord of all". In order to invoke his divine protection, his worshippers carved hexagonal symbols known as 'gromoviti znaci' onto the beams and foundations of their homes in the hope that Perun would protect them from lightning storms. Like several gods from other cultures, Perun seems to be derived from 'Perkwunos', a widely worshipped Indo-European thunder god. From Perkwunos comes the Thracian god 'Perkon' and the Hittite god 'Pirwa', as well as the Greek work for 'thunderbolt', 'karaunos'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_sogdian_warriors_long	Sogdia was once a belligerent power to the north of Persia, independent buffer between the Archaemenids and the nomadic Scythians. That all changed, however, after Alexander the Great conquered the Sogdian Rock and merged the territory with Baktria, shattering the military power of both in the process. After subjugation by Alexander, Sogdians became traders, cementing themselves far along the Silk Road. In approximately AD260, the Sogdian central city, Samarkand, was conquered by the Sassanid Empire, following which it became a major religious centre, spreading Manichaeism into Asia. Sogdia's independent military power was forever dismantled but the Sassanids held on to Sogdia until the mid-4th century, when the nomadic confederation of Hephtalites seized the region.	true

Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_noble_spearmen_long	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master a polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in a short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_cataphracti	Having faced the deadly Parthian cataphracts at Carrhae, come off worse, and then struggled against the awesome crushing strength of the Sarmatian lancers, it wasn't long before the Roman army was tailoring its own cavalry to match, despite resisting the idea for some time. Gradually, Rome began to integrate its own versions, the catafractarii and clibinarii, into the Legions. They were probably first fielded during the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, as an auxiliary force of Gauls and Pannonians. However, despite their general success, it was the 4th century AD before catafractarii became a permanent addition to the ranks, possibly due to Macrinus' catastrophic defeat at Nisibis in AD217, by the Parthians. Covered head-to-foot in scale or mail armour, and armed with lances, it is clear that the 'iron horsemen' were the forerunners to the more familiar knights of the Medieval age.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_warriors_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_fianna_long	In Celtic Ireland, ‘fianna’ were independent bands of men and women, often aristocratic but yet to inherit, who proved their mettle in service of a local lord. As such, they were supplied with food and shelter during the winter months in return for keeping the peace. In the summer, the members of the fianna – known as ‘fian’ – had to hunt for their own food, making additional income from selling the pelts of animals they had eaten. Fianna and their exploits are featured heavily in Irish folklore, particularly the Ulster Cycle - in which a band of twenty-seven fian are led by the druid Cathbad - and the Fenian Cycle – in which the mythical warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill leads them to victory against the enemies of the High King.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_warriors_long	The longsword was a weapon of high worth and status within the Celtic community. A warrior had to prove himself in battle many times before he was permitted to wield one. The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground. On the other hand, since Celtic ironworking was several centuries old, some believe that Roman accounts of this practice mistook this practise, and it was actually a ritual to 'decommission' defeated, dishonoured or damaged weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_pikes_long	Once use of the pike in battle had spread to the west, it was adopted by many of the barbarian tribes. As an extension of the popular 'shield wall' formation, emergent barbarian pike tactics had similarities to the phalanx combat of the Greek city-states and the Macedonian pike reforms that won half the world for Alexander the Great. However, tribal pike troops fought far more defensively than the Greeks, especially with the advent of heavy cavalry such as lancers and their supplanting of the more traditional barbarian infantry charge with brutal shock tactics. Gradually, pikes became a popular defensive choice all over northern Europe; the Norsemen used them in a similar, circular formation of around 1,000 men in a tightly-packed mass, designed to stop enemy cavalry charges dead in their tracks. This also likely gave rise to the later ‘schiltron’ or ‘shield troop’ formation commonly used by Scottish medieval armies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_adana_marksmen_long	Hunting animals for their meat and skins has been happening almost as long as humans have existed, so as time wore on it was only natural that the skills learned – the combination of stealth and the element of surprise – would find an application on the battlefield. This was especially true in the forests of barbarian Europe and the plains of the desert kingdoms of Africa and Arabia, where limited agricultural yield meant that hunting skills were essential for survival. Over time, wily generals realised that hunters could be put to good use in the field, especially for scouting, tracking enemy positions and laying ambushes. When fighting on home territory, those who knew the terrain well would be able to surprise the enemy, deal a disconcerting and potentially disastrous blow, and then disappear - only to re-appear in an similarly unexpected place, at equally opportune moment.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gothic_pikemen_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_noble_archers	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. People of nomadic origin, such as the Sarmatians, Huns and Avars, were renowned as skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_king's_radif_long	The Lakhmids were clients to the Sassanid Kings. Originating in Yemen, on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, they settled and ruled from Al-Hira, in what eventually became central Iraq. Al-Hira was said to be a paradise on earth, but more importantly was a Sassanid asset outside of Arabia. As Sassanid clients, they rendered military service to their overlords, as well as taking a political role - even helping the Emperor Bahram V seize the throne in AD420. The Lakhmids also fought against the Eastern Romans throughout the 4th century alongside the Sassanids, who offered religious tolerance and freedom from Roman Orthodox Christianity.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_axe_hirdmen	Although the vast majority of Germanic warriors fought with spears - even as the Middle Ages dawned - the axe became more and more prevalent due to its effectiveness in penetrating the heavier types of armour of the period. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, could be used to pull aside or split shields, and were effective against plate or chainmail armour as, even if it didn't find the optimum angle to split it, a blow could still shatter bones and crush the organs beneath. One-handed axes may have been the most practical to carry and use, but two-handed axes were also common - the bearer requiring great upper-body strength to pick the weapon up and swing it repeatedly in combat.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_warlord_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_spear_masters_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces. Brought up on the traditions of feasting and raiding, they craved the opportunity to prove themselves against a worthy enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_kondura	The 'sagena' - meaning 'arrow' - and its smaller cousin the 'kondura' were the vessels of choice of the Narentine pirates, Slavic pagans who switched fishing for piracy and the slave trade during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Probably based on the Nordic drakkar, these ships were long, slender and shallow, which made them considerably faster than the opposition. The sagena could carry up to forty warriors and the kondura half that number. The ability to outrun the Byzantine Roman authorities, coupled with their capture of Papal emissaries on their way to Constantinople in AD870, intimidated them to the point where Emperor Constantine VII ordered a large amount for use in his own fleets. The most famous example to be discovered is the so-called 'Condura Croatica', found buried in the town of Nin in 1966, and dated to the 14th century - indicating that the kondura and sagena were hardy and effective enough to remain in production for many centuries.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_onager_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_sons_of_the_invincible_mahrem_long	Prior to their conversion to Christianity, the people of Aksum practiced their own brand of polytheistic paganism within a system not dissimilar to that of the ancient Greeks. Within their pantheon, Mahrem, also known as Maher, was the god of war, and can be likened to the Greek Ares or the Roman Mars in that he is a representation of its barbarous, untamed, and ill-considered side - as opposed to planned strategy and tactics. As the son of Ishtar, the god of the morning star and the central Aksumite deity, Mahrem held an exalted position above many of the pantheon’s lesser gods. Aksum’s warrior king was even referred to as the "Son of Invincible Mahrem", indicating that not only was he considered a god by his people, but that he ruled over a society in which warfare was central.	true

Although it has been suggested that they originated nearer the Tigris River in Anatolia, they nevertheless made their home in the Alborz, a mountain range to the north of what is now modern-day Iran. Known for their fierceness, Dailamite men were employed by the Sassanid Empire as high-quality infantry during the wars of late antiquity. At the end of this period, when the Rashidun Caliphate swept through the east, the stalwart Dailamites successfully resisted the Arab conquest from the Alborz, becoming known as the Muslims’ most perfidious enemy. It was not until the rise of the Seljuk Turks in the 11th century that the indomitable strength of the Dailamites finally began to wane.	true

The people who lived there travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_night_raiders_long	The Germanic Harii tribe were a warrior cult, shrouded in mystery. Their warriors were a terrifying prospect if met on the battlefield. Their bodies, shields and weapons were painted black for maximum shock value. The Roman historian, Tacitus, said this of the Harii: “…quite apart from their strength, which exceeds that of the other tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they caused panic, since no enemy could bear a sight so unexpected and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered”.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_dromont	The word 'dromont' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes.

It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_mounted_spear	Like other former barbarian kingdoms, the Franks inherited much of the Roman Empire's military and societal structure, not just its territory. Once again, cavalry was an aristocratic division as only wealthy landowners could afford horses and therefore provide cavalry during times of war. Elite cavalry, by extension, was drawn only from the most highly-skilled among them. They, more than any other, could afford not only the horse, but the mail and plate armour required; 'brunia' body armour was the single most expensive piece of military equipment of the age, costing more than the horse itself. Some took this to excess, adorning their armour with jewels and other finery, but Charlemagne was known to have criticised his noblemen for such ostentatious displays. In battle, Carolingian cavalry favoured a mass charge of spears to break the enemy quickly. This worked particularly well on favourable, flat terrain but led to problems on less-than-ideal topography. In fact, cavalry was still considered inferior until long after the Battle of Tours when, due to a failure in mobilisation, Charles Martel won the battle without any heavy horse at all. Standard Frankish horsemen were lightly armoured (wearing little more than padded cloth), carried spears and shields, and were best-suited for bringing home a cavalry charge and then, once involved in the fray, remaining to press the attack.	true

Formed later in the Roman Empire as a temporary adjunct to the Legions, they became known as a ‘vexillationes’ following a reorganisation and expansion of Roman cavalry forces. In the years immediately prior the Legions had taken some heavy losses from the superior horse units of the eastern empires. This reorganisation was almost certainly an attempt to curb Roman losses and enable them to compete with the enemy's burgeoning cavalry tactics. In any case, the Dalmatae were the largest of the newly-raised vexillationes, and contributed to Claudius II victory over the Goths – a worthy record indeed!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_levy_skirmishers_long	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army, whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and a greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_bet_giorgis_cavalry_long	Saint George is one of those rare people – someone venerated across all the major Christian Churches, regardless of their differences. This is probably because his martyrdom was representative of the struggle all early Christians against the pagan states who held power during antiquity. George was an officer in the Roman army, of Greek parentage and probably born in Syria around AD275. He was put to death by the murderous Emperor Diocletian, during a purge of non-pagans in the Roman army. Given the opportunity to recant his Christianity, he refused and instead proclaimed his faith publicly. Even though the Emperor thought highly of his late father, George was executed lest Diocletian appear weak in front of his officers – something which had led to the death of many an erstwhile Roman Emperor before him. Saint George’s martyrdom is celebrated (in the Julian calendar) on 23rd April, and he has since become the patron of many places and (usually military) professions. Saint George is probably most famous in England, where he is known for slaying the dragon in a highly-apocryphal story brought back from Palestine by the Crusaders.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_coracle	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_gastald_cav	In the Lombard kingdom 'gastald' were both civil, judicial and military administrators, responsible for governing the urban parts of the kingdom in the ruler's stead ('reeves' performed the same function in rural areas). Gastald owed their allegiance directly to the king, which caused friction between them and the extremely territorial dukes, who held great sway within the Lombard state and desired to rule autonomously. As royal power within the Lombard kingdom waned, so too did the gastald - their influence being restricted to purely administrative matters. By the beginning of the Medieval age the title had almost entirely disappeared from use, save for officials in the emergent city-states of Milan, Pisa and Venice, in some cases surviving right up to the time of the Napoleonic Wars.	true

Although mounted troops were terrifying and effective as shock cavalry, charging down enemy lines and wreaking havoc, they also performed another, equally important function on the battlefield. Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horsemen made excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen for their main hosts, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_svarogs_raiders_long	Unfortunately, primary sources regarding pre-Christian Slavic paganism are thin on the ground, so Svarog is first mentioned in the Hypatian Codex of the 15th century - written about a thousand years later and well into the Christian era. Svarog is the god of fire in the Slavic pantheon with both a lunar and solar aspect, each signifying different traits. As the father of the sun god, Dazbog, he is the patron of light, brightness and flames, and by extension smithing and the forge - similar to and possibly another aspect of the Greek god Hephaestus. Svarog's connection to the Greek pantheon also belies how ancient a god he is, indicating that his presence in the Slavic one may be because the Slavs eventually settled lands formerly occupied by Greek tribes in pre-Roman times. Having said that, there are evidently many connections between gods of different cultures; as such, Svarog is similar to the Sanskrit word 'svarga', meaning 'sky' or 'the heavens'. His symbol is the 'sun wheel' or 'spinning wheel' - 'kolovrat' or 'kolovratok' - used to mark graves as a symbol of eternal life, but also representing Slavic culture and paganism as a whole, in a similar way to the gammadion or swastika.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_spearmen_long	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master a polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in a short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_horsemen_long	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nom_bosphoran_warriors_long	The Bosporan Kingdom was a client of the Roman Empire. It outlasted all others, only briefly becoming a province under the Emperor Nero. Located in Crimea, on the shores of the Cimmerian Bosporus, its prosperous territory was originally a Greek colony. A large amount of archaeological evidence has since been uncovered there, including gold work, imported goods and textile fragments. The remains of the city of Panticapaeum, which was built on Mount Mithridat, still stand today, despite being hit by an earthquake in 70BC and sacked by the Huns in AD370. This is largely due to a revival during the Roman period that saw these great cities protected and incorporated into new fortresses.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_des_garamantian_lancers_long	The Garamantians were a Saharan people who created an empire based on the slave trade and used a sophisticated network of irrigation tunnels for their water supplies. This vital water supported cattle and wheat farming, enabling the Garamantians to dominate much of Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa. At times, this expansion threatened Carthage and Ptolemaic Egypt, who also prized their fierce warriors as mercenaries. A reliance on slaves and freemen of low birth, much like the Spartans, enabled the Garamantians to develop a skilled military elite famed for their horsemanship and four-horse chariots. Unfortunately, as the water ran out, so did the fortunes of the Garamantians. Unable to support their towns and territories, their military power dwindled - they could no longer get the slaves they needed to secure more water.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lon_light_mel_slav_long	The 'sagena' - meaning 'arrow' - and its smaller cousin the 'kondura' were the vessels of choice of the Narentine pirates, Slavic pagans who switched fishing for piracy and the slave trade during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Probably based on the Nordic drakkar, these ships were long, slender and shallow, which made them considerably faster than the opposition. The sagena could carry up to forty warriors and the kondura half that number. The ability to outrun the Byzantine Roman authorities, coupled with their capture of Papal emissaries on their way to Constantinople in AD870, intimidated them to the point where Emperor Constantine VII ordered a large amount for use in his own fleets. The most famous example to be discovered is the so-called 'Condura Croatica', found buried in the town of Nin in 1966, and dated to the 14th century - indicating that the kondura and sagena were hardy and effective enough to remain in production for many centuries.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_tanist_long	‘Tanistry’ was the system used to organise inheritance of land and titles in Celtic Ireland and Scotland. The ‘Tanist’ of a clan was heir to the chieftain or king, chosen from one of several ‘righdamnhna’ - literally “those of kingly material” – candidates for the throne whose eligibility was based on sharing the same great-grandfather. The Tanist was elected for life by a full assembly of the clan heads, and automatically became ruler upon the death or disqualification of the current incumbent. This meant that the ruler wouldn’t necessarily be the son of his predecessor, but would at least be his brother, nephew or cousin. Of course, this sort of system encouraged politicking, and much blood was shed from kingly ambitions as a result.	true

The evolution of the Eastern Roman army saw the classic Roman infantry model evolve into 'skutatoi'. These men, unlike the privately-owned bucellarii, were professional soldiers, recruited from among loyal citizens who wished to defend their homes and the Emperor. By the 6th century AD, skutatoi were the armoured bulk of the infantry forces of any Roman army, making up two thirds of every 'chiliarchiai' division - the remaining third being archers who supported the melee troops. Armed with the deadly, three metre-long kontarion - based on the kontos lance favoured by cataphracts - some skutatoi were positioned on the front lines to repel cavalry, with their sword-armed counterparts behind them, ready for the melee that followed the initial charge.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_archers_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_onager_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_cohors_long	The Roman army was heavily structured, from the highest position down to the individual man. 'Legion' was the name most associated with Roman forces, but in reality groups of 'cohors' were formed and becoming the basic tactical unit around which all Roman infantry divisions were formed. The cohor was first used during the Second Punic War, becoming solidified following the military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107BC, and then codified in the 1st century AD. Each cohor consisted of several 'centuries' of eighty fighting men and twenty administrators, multiples of which built a Legion. Cohors also served specific purposes, such as the nine 'Cohors Praetoriae' - the legendary Praetorians who defended many Emperors, and toppled many others, until their replacement in AD312 following Constantine's military reforms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_horse_archers	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. People of nomadic origin, such as the Sarmatians, Huns and Avars, were renowned as skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_slav_spear	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_armoured_spear	From the most inexperienced fighter to the most battle-hardened elite, the spear remained the cheapest, most accessible and therefore common weapon of the Carolingian era. Historically, the weapon of the lower classes, the spear eventually became more prominent amongst all classes of military society; an entire force of armoured spearmen assaulted the palace of Lateran in AD769, for example. Changes in the types of opponent led to development of weapons in order to defeat them. 'Lugs' - or wings - started to appear under the blade in order to hook and grab at armour and 'languets' - protrusions from the shaft itself - were added to protect the user, further evidence that the spear was used for prolonged, matched combat against heavily-armoured cavalry.	true

For instance, Frumentius, a Tyrene slave who went on to become the first Bishop of Aksum, influenced the politics of the region even before he was ordained. As a civil servant, he first converted King Ezana to Christianity and later was regent to the Aksumite crown prince after Ezana's death. During this time he granted Christians religious freedom and, after being ordained and establishing a Holy See, became known as "Abuna" ("Our Father") amongst his congregation. Such was Frumentius' renown and importance to Aksumite politics, future kings refused Roman requests to replace him with someone they felt would better serve Imperial interests.	true

First noted as swift 'runners' who backed up charioteers during the Bronze Age in Pharaonic Egypt. The first account of "horse-stabbing" is by Caesar during his Gallic conquests. Caesar recounts the effectiveness of the enemy, who broke his horsemen and terrified their steeds. He was so impressed that, upon their defeat, he drafted horse hewers into his army and used them in future campaigns. Horse-stabbers (or 'hewers' as they are sometimes called) were also depicted on coins throughout late antiquity, particulary on pagan iconography. Several tribes also made fully-fledged military divisions of horse-stabbers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_vandal_raiders_long	Originally thought to be from Scandinavia, and settling in Poland during the 2nd century BC, the Vandals were a confederation of Germanic tribes who went on to successfully migrate down through Europe and into Africa, forming a kingdom there in AD439. They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_cav	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_comitatensis_spears_long	In the face of an increasing number of barbarian incursions, the effective defence of Rome’s now-sprawling territory became a serious problem in the 4th century AD. The Emperor Constantine’s controversial solution was to divide the army into two halves. 'Comitatenses' were the late-Roman equivalent of the traditional Legionaries, designed to swoop in and decisively defeat enemy forces already pinned down by 'limitanei', the frontier garrison troops tasked with guarding the 'limes' - the borderlands of the Empire. Although originally intended to be the Emperor’s own elite palace guard, the Empire’s increasingly difficult border situation led to comitatenses becoming Rome’s main field armies. Led by a 'comte', the root of the noble title ‘count’ - itself a Latinised version of 'companion' in reference to Alexander's friends and compatriots - comitatenses were professional soldiers every bit as dangerous as their Legionary forebears.	true

These seams, mined by both Carthage and Rome in centuries past, were reopened by the Umayyads, who then used the resultant wealth to import well-made weapons and armour from across Europe as well as creating their own.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_horsemen_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_guard	As long as there have been kings and queens, there has been an elite cadre of men charged with defending them. From Philip of Macedon's Somatophylakes or the Roman Praetorian Guard to the Mongolian Kheshig or the Forbidden Troops of Tang Dynasty China, the very best military men have always defended their leaders. The proximity that royal guards had to their rulers often meant that the political power they wielded was amplified to the point that crises would often be determined by which side the royal defenders backed; if they stayed loyal, then the leadership often survived, but if they defected, the ruler would be supplanted in favour of a candidate of their choosing, if not one of their own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_warband_long	The longsword was a weapon of high worth and status within the Celtic community. A warrior had to prove himself in battle many times before he was permitted to wield one. The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground. On the other hand, since Celtic ironworking was several centuries old, some believe that Roman accounts of this practice mistook this practise, and it was actually a ritual to 'decommission' defeated, dishonoured or damaged weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_marz_archers_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_followers_veles_long	Veles is the Slavic god of the underworld. As part of their polytheistic pantheon, he is also attached to natural elements like the earth, forests and water. Things that are 'below' like caves and springs, too, fall under his purview - literally the 'under' world. Veles is in direct opposition to Perun, thunder god and lord of the 'quintheism'. Perun lives above, in the sky, and is depicted as fiery and dry - diametrically opposed to Veles and his damp, dark corners of the earth. In Slavic mythology, the two fought one another - Perun hurling lightning from the sky and chasing down his opponent. This concept of lightning storms as manifestations of Perun's power was extremely important to the Slavs, in a similar way as it was in many other pantheons - notably, the Greek thunder god Zeus, and the Nordic Thor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_savaran_cataphracts_long	The Savaran were a wide-ranging cavalry division under the Sassanid Empire, fielding horsemen from light skirmishes and horseback archers to heavy cataphracts. They were generally drawn from nobility, with the highest posts marked for those from the House of Sassan, and those of Parthian descent. They used a variety of weapons; the Parthian spear being the most famous, but also lances, swords, maces and axes. Sassanid cavalry was born out of the need for a highly-mobile military force that could potentially fight a war on two fronts and make use of the eastern steppes, particularly against the infantry-heavy forces of the western powers of the age. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_warlord_long	A Celtic tribesman reached manhood at fourteen years of age and, depending on his status, he could carry arms from then on. Nobles could also recruit their own following, building both reputation and influence through their clients, but proving their worth in battle was the start. Without bravery in a potential leader, no freeman would follow. A man's future, if he lived, was therefore entirely dependent on his showing in battle, and this led to bravery being a commonplace occurrence. Like their elders, Celtic youths were not above goading their opponents with insults and taunts, and they used 'carnyx' battle horns to instil fear in their foes. Inexperience, as with all young men, led them to sometimes act rashly where a little caution might have served them better.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_hurlers_long	Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gothic_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_axe_freemen	Although the vast majority of Germanic warriors fought with spears - even as the Middle Ages dawned - the axe became more and more prevalent due to its effectiveness in penetrating the heavier types of armour of the period. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, could be used to pull aside or split shields, and were effective against plate or chainmail armour as, even if it didn't find the optimum angle to split it, a blow could still shatter bones and crush the organs beneath. One-handed axes may have been the most practical to carry and use, but two-handed axes were also common - the bearer requiring great upper-body strength to pick the weapon up and swing it repeatedly in combat.	true

As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. Also, when faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to back away from fights. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made controlling them considerably easier and conveyed another advantage; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick off targets with some ease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_armoured_spear	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_amazon_archers_long	Many myths surround the Amazons, a legendary tribe of hunters and warrior-women, such as the story of Queen Hippolyta's magical girdle sought by Herakles. A female-dominated society, supposedly descended from Ares, they were reputed to have lived on the shores of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus, the Amazons were killers of men and a popular source of artistic and poetic inspiration within Greek culture. When necessary, they intermingled with the all-male Gargareans to keep up their numbers, or enslaved the few men they needed after raids or battles. Depicted as superb archers, the Amazons are also often shown carrying spears, axes and crescent-shaped shields. Archaeology suggests Sarmatian and Scythian women participated in battle, which may be the source of the Amazons’ legend.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_bowmen_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_art_slav_long	The 'sagena' - meaning 'arrow' - and its smaller cousin the 'kondura' were the vessels of choice of the Narentine pirates, Slavic pagans who switched fishing for piracy and the slave trade during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Probably based on the Nordic drakkar, these ships were long, slender and shallow, which made them considerably faster than the opposition. The sagena could carry up to forty warriors and the kondura half that number. The ability to outrun the Byzantine Roman authorities, coupled with their capture of Papal emissaries on their way to Constantinople in AD870, intimidated them to the point where Emperor Constantine VII ordered a large amount for use in his own fleets. The most famous example to be discovered is the so-called 'Condura Croatica', found buried in the town of Nin in 1966, and dated to the 14th century - indicating that the kondura and sagena were hardy and effective enough to remain in production for many centuries.	true

The disruption of a cattle supply, therefore, could be catastrophic. Cattle Raiding was the source of much of the strife and conflict through Celtic Ireland, and was so prominent that it was featured heavily in early Irish literature, specifically the 'Táin Bó', or Cattle Raiding tales. Though considered fiction, much of the content is based on reality; cattle were the source of lightning raids and larger pitched battles alike.

Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_alani_swordsmen_long	Alani warriors were known to be strong and fierce - the Roman historian Marcellinus spoke of them in complimentary terms, calling them "men of great stature and beauty" with "terribly fierce" eyes. Their hardiness and determination is hardly surprising, given their lives on the harsh, eastern steppes, and then coping with upheaval and migration westward brought on by the appearance of the Huns. The Alans, Sarmatians and indeed all the nomadic tribes had no choice but to master this unforgiving life, be destroyed or consumed by a stronger people. The fierceness of Alani warriors was demonstrated at the Battle of Adrianople in AD378, when a Gothic and Vandal army, bolstered by Alani infantry, outflanked and destroyed Roman forces under Emperor Valens. With the Alani infantry engaged at their front, and Gothic cavalry surrounding them, the Romans were decisively defeated. Abandoned by his bodyguards, Valens' body was never found.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_antesignani	Some soldiers were trained for the singular purpose of fighting in a battle line, or firing a bow, or riding a horse. These men could become elite and irreplaceable in this position, yet antesignani were different. They were elite Roman Legionaries who were also proficient in fighting out of formation, skirmishing and harrying the enemy in an unconventional way – specialists in unconventional battlefield roles. Armoured as other Legionaries, and armed with spears, javelins and a gladius, antesignani were able to screen the advancing columns of infantry and perform counter-skirmish manoeuvres. Yet they were also resolute and stalwart when placed in a forward battle line; Belisarius' rival general, Narses, used antesignani at the Battle of Volturnus in AD554, where they held the centre, dressed head to toe in chainmail, leading to a resounding victory for the Romans.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gothic_archers_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_scaled_clubmen_long	Scale armour arguably provides greater defence against than the standard chainmail that came to dominate late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Overlapping armour plates of metal, leather or horn - in varying shapes (but usually squares or fish scales) - were attached to one another and then sewn to an undershirt of cloth or leather in rows. Scales were used extensively by nomadic warriors such as the Scythians and Sarmatians, and eventually by the Romans too. They used scale mail - or 'lorica squamata' - from the days of the Roman Republic, although it was eventually superseded by the more famous 'lorica segmentata' commonly worn by Legionaries of the post-Marian period. Scale armour was also used far from Europe, where Japanese samurai warriors wore 'kozane' - literally 'fish scales' - from the 11th century AD onwards, before the advent of plate armour (which could stop bullets) relegated it to a ceremonial capacity only.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_desert_pikes_long	A two-handed spear or pike, varying from four to seven metres in length, became widely adopted in ancient armies. With an iron tip and a bronze butt-spike, which provided balance and could be dug into the ground to hold a charge, the pike was an effective weapon when used en masse. A tightly formed wall of pike-armed infantry presented an almost impenetrable barrier to other foot units and especially to cavalry, whose mounts would balk at the charge when faced with so many spearpoints. When advancing in close order against the enemy, each man occupied a square roughly 90cm to a side with the pike of the first five ranks projecting beyond. When defending they formed up even tighter, locking together with each man resting his shield on the man in front for greater stability. Such formations sacrificed manoeuvrability however, making their main weakness their flanks and rear.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_onager_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nom_steppe_mounted_bows_long	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_pictish_crossbowmen	Thought to have been invented simultaneously in both Greece and China during the 5th century BC, various forms of crossbow spread rapidly across Europe, even appearing on Pictish standing stones in the far north of Britain. An early attempt to automate the simple bow, the crossbow works by mounting a bow horizontally on a barrel or stock that, once fitted with a ‘bolt’, can be drawn with a ratchet mechanism to much greater tension than a man alone can generate before being braced against the shoulder for firing. This means that, despite the superior accuracy and rates of fire afforded by the traditional bow, the crossbow can penetrate heavy armour more effectively. Also, unlike the bow, which takes many years of training and practice to master, an unskilled man can be taught to use a crossbow well within a week. Comparably poor accuracy was the weapon’s only real downside, but since it could be held in tension for a much longer period of time, crossbowmen often had time to pick and choose their shots carefully.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_brigands_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_brigands_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_brigands_long	The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, they had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant they often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_adana_trackers_long	Hunting animals for their meat and skins has been happening almost as long as humans have existed, so as time wore on it was only natural that the skills learned – the combination of stealth and the element of surprise – would find an application on the battlefield. This was especially true in the forests of barbarian Europe and the plains of the desert kingdoms of Africa and Arabia, where limited agricultural yield meant that hunting skills were essential for survival. Over time, wily generals realised that hunters could be put to good use in the field, especially for scouting, tracking enemy positions and laying ambushes. When fighting on home territory, those who knew the terrain well would be able to surprise the enemy, deal a disconcerting and potentially disastrous blow, and then disappear - only to re-appear in an similarly unexpected place, at equally opportune moment.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_rumha_warriors_long	The javelin is among the oldest weapons in the world. Equipped with javelins and little else, skirmishers harried both their opposite numbers and more tightly-packed melee infantry, peppering them before quickly retreating. This was the typical tactic of all unarmoured, javelin-armed troops of the age: to appear as if from nowhere, rain fire down on the enemy, and then retreat back into the terrain. Such harassment could be highly effective, particularly on the vast plains of the desert kingdoms, where a mobile, almost guerrilla style of warfare worked better than the regimented Roman battle lines that had conquered the west. The desert peoples saw war as a way of life - historical sources have very little information about their large scale battles, but often mention them as raiders in search of loot. In lightning fast raids, skirmish tactics using the javelin, alongside heavy cavalry, would have been vital to achieving a swift victory.	true

Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horsemen were excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen for the main force, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks. More nimble melee cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreating before the enemy could effectively counter-attack.	true

Cornuti are famous for their 'barritus', an un-nerving combination of war dance and war cry, with which their presence on the battlefield was announced to the enemy. Recruited exclusively from the Roman territory of Gaul, cornuti were noted at several important battles of the late Roman period, such as Verona and Milvian Bridge, during Constantine and Maxentius' civil war of AD350 - 353. At Argentorum, in AD357, units of cornuti faced fellow Germans of the extremely warlike Alaman confederation and defeated them, despite being heavily outnumbered on the day. 'Cornuti seniores' were seasoned veteran soldiers, mentioned in the Notitia Dignitarum as part of the make-up of Western Roman armies at the beginning of the 5th century. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_pictish_swords_long	The Picts lived in northern and eastern Britannia, and successfully drove away all attempts to take the fertile lowlands of their homeland for hundreds of years. Despite defeating the Picts at Mons Graupius around AD83, the Romans never fully conquered their lands, building a wall on the orders of Emperor Hadrian in order to control Pictish raids and martial their trade with the Britons. Where knowledge of terrain was key, the Picts used the land to their advantage, drawing invaders deep into their territory before giving battle. After the Romans departed, this tactic was used to great effect at the Battle of Dun Nechtain. When the Angles attacked they were drawn further and further north until the Picts finally drove their entire army into a loch.	true

They fought famously at the Battle of Thermopylae, flanking the redoubtable Spartans and ultimately securing victory. Although disappearing with the Archaemenids, the Immortals were revived under the Sassanids as an elite corps, with the finest armour and weapons of their entire military, and adorned in fine livery to demonstrate their prestige.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_gazelhounds	Dogs have always been useful for guard, patrol and scout work. With skilled handlers they can also be used effectively on the battlefield. Attack dogs were specifically bred and trained to ignore the noise and chaos of combat.

Faced with a pack of foaming, hungry dogs many men naturally broke or faltered, opening gaps in a battle line that could then be exploited by melee troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_kushite_shotelai_long	The shotel is a thin, broadly circular bladed sword. It is often referred to as a 'sickle sword', a term applied to many similar curved weapons, such as the scimitar, the Persian shamshir and the Egyptian khopesh. Shotelai fought exclusively with the shotel, using the blade's shape to strike around their opponent's shields, penetrating their defences and hitting them in key areas; the kidneys or the lungs were common targets. The blade on a shotel varied from that of a shamshir or a kopesh as it was nearly a full semicircle, making it more awkward for the user to wield. In the hands of an experienced swordsman, however, its potential for death was magnified. 	true

The Amazigh spent most of antiquity under Roman rule in Cyrenaica, yet fought in a series of struggles, both open and underground, against their overlords for hundreds of years. As the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the Amazigh were thrown into disorder, but an opportunistic one. The shattering of Imperial authority marked the return of the Berbers from the fringes of the Empire, allowing them to resettle as they pleased: there is evidence of Berber kingdoms rising all across the defunct African province. 	true

A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. In Africa and the eastern deserts, there were few changes to the spear's design over the ensuing millennia other than advances in metal work (iron replacing bronze tips). For instance, the most popular African spear type, still used by Zulu hunters, remains the ‘assegai’, which is intentionally light-weight so it can be either thrusted or thrown, depending on the situation its bearer finds himself in. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_armenian_slingers_long	The Kingdom of Armenia was a crossroads between Persia and Rome, and its military style was influenced by both sides. In late antiquity, Armenian territory was highly contested between the Sassanid and Eastern Roman Empires. Militarily-speaking, its archers were a source of remark, with some sources suggesting they could reliably kill from up to 200 metres. Its cavalry, too, was renowned, and that mountain people could breed such excellent riding stock was often a source of surprise amongst their opponents. Under the Sassanid Empire, Armenian cavalry was honoured as elite, alongside the Savaran, with a position of distinction at the royal capital, Ctesiphon.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_barbed_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_select_spear	The 'fyrd' was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary farmers - 'freemen', in the parlance of the times, meaning those not tied to a lord as vassals. The infrequent but bloody struggles between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the early Middle Ages, and the Viking threat that followed, meant that the process of levying troops to fight was still necessary. If people are fighting for their very homes and livelihoods - not just a distant figurehead of a monarch - they tend to have a sense of purpose and urgency. Courage can come later, bolstered by massed ranks in the mean time, as can proficiency - there was rarely much time set aside for training amateurs before a battle. Originally, every able man was recruited to fight but this revealed a flaw in that if a war or struggle became protracted, or if too many people died, then there would be nobody to work the fields at its conclusion. To this end, the Anglo-Saxons developed what we now call the "select" system, where only those deemed most able would be chosen to join the fyrd. The remainder would stay at work, creating a surplus of provisions and equipment for both the marching army and those left behind in order to sustain the realm and improve the army's chances of victory. In practice, the majority of men were not levied, so many were expected to service the war machine in other practical ways. The fyrd were called upon on many occasions during the years of the Viking invasions, most famously to fight the Norwegian king Harold Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, just weeks before the cataclysmic Saxon defeat at Hastings.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_transport	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where ships could go. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true

As such, all manner of things were adopted and adapted by those who guarded their sections of the routes, including a variety of military equipment and the knowledge needed to use it to best advantage. Two such weapons are the khanda - the famous Sikh sword - and the fenestrated axe, which both came to the Arabian and southern African kingdoms via their trade connections with India. The khanda has a blunt point but an extremely sharp blade, being designed to slash rather than stab like the Roman gladius.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_sahnegohrim_long	Judaism spread from the Levant to southern Arabia some time after AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Second Temple and brought the Great Jewish Revolt to an end. Deprived of their sovereign state, the Jews scattered, forming smaller diaspora as far away from Rome as possible. Some evidence exists of monotheist tendencies in Himyar around the 2nd century AD, but it was not until the reign of Dharamar Ayman, in AD375, that there was any explicit reference to Himyarite Judaism. The Himyarites had been a militaristic society for hundreds of years, and had constantly been at war with Kingdom of Aksum; their conversion was, in many ways, just another reason for their ceaseless conflict with the Christian Aksumites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_hearth_guard	The Saxon hearth companion was similar in many ways to the thegns of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. As a personal friend of the king, he protected his lord on the battlefield, and in return the king bestowed gifts, titles, lands and power. The very name 'hearth' friend or companion implies closeness to the king, eating and sharing his company around the fire, through which great bonds of friendship and loyalty were made. When not at war, hearth companions were the closest thing to a local police force - enforcing the king's will and administering justice within the provinces they governed on his behalf.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_sarmatian_band_long	Unlike their Scythian cousins, the Sarmatians favoured a much more belligerent style of warfare, not unlike that of the Parthians - heavy, shock cavalry strikes backed up by infantry and archers. The best and the boldest fighters formed the cavalry hordes, yet foot soldiers were nevertheless expected to do their duty. Even the lowest tribesman was trained, by his very lifestyle - the transient, constant movement of steppe life meant that strength, endurance and discipline were automatically instilled from a very early age - the skills needed to deconstruct a camp, gather the animals and move; in essence, to pack up their lives swiftly. This made Sarmatian men and women strong, determined, tougher than most of their enemies and above all ready to fight at a moment's notice. In short, a terrifying enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_mavia's_bodyguards_long	Mavia, Queen of the Tanukhids, was relatively unknown to history until her legendary revolution against the Roman Empire, succeeding where Zenobia of Palmyra failed 100 years before. Indeed, Mavia is considered by most sources a 'warrior queen', indicating she was recognised primarily by her military deeds which, unusually for the time, made her gender irrelevant. In AD378, three years after the death of her husband, peace dissolved and Mavia began a large offensive campaign against the Romans. Her reasons seem to be religious - Emperor Valens sought to supplant the Tanukhid's Orthodox Christianity with his own brand of Arianism, and so Mavia went to war. She often rode at the head of her armies and struck fast into Roman territory, anticipating Imperial tactics and remaining fluid. As the Tanukhids had no central base of operations, the Romans found it difficult to combat their tactics - appearing as they did to be everywhere and nowhere all at once. Mavia's army bested the Romans in open battle on several occasions, and mercilessly butchered those in its way. In the end Valens capitulated, granting Mavia her demand and naming Moses bishop to the Tanukhid people. Despite her stunning victory, Mavia's glory seems to have lived and died with the war as, after peace was brokered, there is little recorded about the rest of her life.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_levy_axemen	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_imperial_dromedarii	'Dromedarii' were camel-riding auxiliary troops recruited in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire and designed to take the place of light horse cavalry when fighting in desert conditions. Although useful for screening infantry and scouting ahead, they were also used to counter horsemen, due to the natural aversion of horses to the smell of camels. Due to their geographical location dromedarii were peculiar to the Eastern Romans, providing a useful indigenous cavalry force for fighting along their frontier with Sassanid Persia.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_mounted_bowmen_long	Born from a tradition of raiding nomadic tribesmen, mounted archery became firmly established in the ancient world, leading to some highly effective battlefield units. While foot archers could be equipped with longer, more powerful bows, the mounted archer was still a formidable opponent thanks to the design of the composite bow. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden variety. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina to use well, the composite bow demanded respect, care and attention. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_foot_archers	Most eastern barbarians were raised as hunters, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_axe_heerbann_long	Amongst the Franks the term 'heerbann' was used to describe freemen called to bear arms for their country on a contractual basis, rather like the Anglo-Saxon 'fyrd' who came after them. Months prior to embarking on a military campaign the Franks mustered a heerbann, allowing time for them to equip, assemble and train for the conflict ahead. Ignoring a call to join could lead to harsh penalties, although heeding it also had its downsides, as many minor landowners struggled to afford their own armour and weapons. Although changed by the advent of the feudal system, the custom of calling a heerbann remained in place until around the time of the Crusades, gradually evolving into the Medieval French word 'arriere-ban'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_thracian_warriors_long	Called by the Roman historian Livy, along with the Gauls, “…the most warlike of all nations”, the Thracians were renowned warriors whose prowess in battle made them much sought after as mercenaries. As skilled horsemen and infantry who excelled in light tactics, Thracians provided up to one third of the cavalry in the Macedonian army and a fifth of its infantry. In the Imperial age, Thracians were one of the largest auxiliary groups within the Roman army, contributing some 20,000 troops. As well as being famed for their prowess in battle, they also bore a reputation for joy in plunder and a vicious disregard for captives. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_large_shields_long	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master a polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in a short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gothic_warband_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_viking_captain_long	The group of Norsemen who became known as ‘Vikings’ referred specifically to the seafarers who raided those lands bordering the North Sea, particularly the sparsely-defended Britannic coasts. Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_eastern_armoured_legio_long	Although the Eastern Roman Empire significantly altered its military style from that of its western arm in later centuries, Eastern armies remained relatively similar in the years immediately following the political divide of AD395. The forces of both Roman Empires remained infantry-heavy, with the Legions - 'Legio' - forming the bulk of any Roman army. The Notitia Dignitatum describes how the Legions were divided into units of comitatenses, auxilia, and the elite palatini. These units were broken down further according to their role - 'comitatus praesantales' were Imperial escorts that traditionally remained with the Emperor at the capital, but also fought with him on campaign. Standard comitatenses were deployed as strategic garrisons, and finally limitanei controlled the frontier itself, acting as an early warning system for barbarian incursions.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_noble_lancers	Developed from the cavalry skills of their ancestors, lancers were a type of heavy cavalry. Those of the nomadic steppe tribes wore scale armour to protect themselves and their mounts, and used a long lance known as a kontos, which enabled them to deliver devastating charges in a fashion comparable to the deadly cataphract cavalry from the east. Their scale armour was made from horn, or later metal, and allowed its wearers to easily run down their western counterparts. However, lancers were still vulnerable to dense pike or spear-armed formations. Archery provided a solution: sustained volleys from skirmishing foot and horse archers were used to thin and spread out the enemy prior to a devastating, thunderous charge.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_warriors_long	The Slavs were first referred to as the "Sclaveni and Antae" from beyond the Carpathian mountains. Historians believe that the myriad Slavic tribes originated mostly in central Europe, possibly from along the southern shores of the Baltic Sea. The Byzantine Roman scholar Procopius called  them strong, tall, and possessed of a neutral temperament that was "neither cruel nor disrespectful". They reminded him of the Huns and he noted how they mostly went into battle armed but not armoured, decrying any overlords, stating "others do not conquer our lands, we conquer theirs". However, it was centuries later that the foundations of future Slavic states were laid; their culture and ideals remained fairly disparate until that point, with individual tribes working independently of, and oft-times against, each other.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_vandal_warlord_long	Originally thought to be from Scandinavia, and settling in Poland during the 2nd century BC, the Vandals were a confederation of Germanic tribes who went on to successfully migrate down through Europe and into Africa, forming a kingdom there in AD439. They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_mounted_warband_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_germanic_mounted_brigands_long	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_jamal_al_rumha_long	Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly, and are less nervous than horses. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. Also, when faced by conventional cavalry the size and odour of camels caused horses to back away from melee. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made controlling them considerably easier; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick off targets with some ease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_equites_dalmatae_long	The ‘Dalmatian horsemen’ hailed from the western Balkans, roughly equivalent to the position of modern-day Croatia. Formed later in the Roman Empire as a temporary adjunct to the Legions, they became known as a ‘vexillationes’ following a reorganisation and expansion of Roman cavalry forces. In the years immediately prior the Legions had taken some heavy losses from the superior horse units of the eastern empires. This reorganisation was almost certainly an attempt to curb Roman losses and enable them to compete with the enemy's burgeoning cavalry tactics. In any case, the Dalmatae were the largest of the newly-raised vexillationes, and contributed to Claudius II victory over the Goths – a worthy record indeed!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_elite_sarmatian_cataphracts_long	The Sarmatians were a steppe people, possibly of Iranian origin, who, following the migrations of the 4th century AD, dwelled along the Danube frontier. Their skill in horsemanship was highly developed, some even crediting them with the invention of the metal stirrup and spur. Today, our knowledge of the Sarmatians is largely due to their burial customs. The Kuban region of southern Russia contains some of the most elaborate Sarmatian tombs, and finds often included a fine array of weapons, metalwork and jewellery that provide a great deal of information about their day to day lives. Full suits of cataphract-style scale armour made for women indicate that female Sarmatians were just as deadly as their male counterparts; it is thought that unmarried women were allowed to ride into battle alongside the men, possibly giving rise to the Greek myth of the Amazons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_andalusian_skirm	Until very recently, when mechanisation reduced the amount of close-quarters fighting required, skirmishers were used to harass, never giving the enemy pause to regroup and distracting them until melee troops or cavalry could pin them down. In the ancient world, particularly among the 'civilised' states of the Mediterranean, many skirmishers were considered highly skilled, with places such as Crete and the Balearic Islands specialising in producing first class archers, slingers and javelineers. In the north and west of Europe, such weapons were generally thought considered cowardly - only fighting hand-to-hand in melee carried the required amount of honour and glory with it. As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blinded to an infantry or cavalry charge bearing down upon them.	true

The 'Herculiani' were named after the Roman divine hero Hercules, known for his strength and epic adventures. The Herculiani and Joviani were potentially raised from the sister Legions Legio V Iovia and Legio VI Herculia, stationed in the province of Pannonia Secunda.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_archers	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_milites	Milite was a professional rank in the Roman army from as far back as the Marian reforms of 107BC. Once the Western Empire collapsed, the power behind the throne - Flavius Odoacer - assumed control of the fragmented Imperial machine, creating his 'Kingdom of Italy' and inhabiting much of the pre-existing Imperial military and civil infrastructure. Under the new regime, milites became the general rank and file infantry troops that constituted the bulk of its army. As unspecialised troops, they lacked any focused training, and were also used away from the battlefield for guard duty, construction works and other rudimentary roles. As time went on, however, the word 'milites' became a general term for soldiers, regardless of their function. Milites generally served for several years in their relatively lowly positions until they could becoming veterans and therefore 'immunes' who, as their name suggests, were excused from the more menial, and often dangerous, tasks assigned to the less experienced troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_fyrd_spear	The 'fyrd' was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary farmers - 'freemen', in the parlance of the times, meaning those not tied to a lord as vassals. The infrequent but bloody struggles between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the early Middle Ages, and the Viking threat that followed, meant that the process of levying troops to fight was still necessary. If people are fighting for their very homes and livelihoods - not just a distant figurehead of a monarch - they tend to have a sense of purpose and urgency. Courage can come later, bolstered by massed ranks in the mean time, as can proficiency - there was rarely much time set aside for training amateurs before a battle. Originally, every able man was recruited to fight but this revealed a flaw in that if a war or struggle became protracted, or if too many people died, then there would be nobody to work the fields at its conclusion. To this end, the Anglo-Saxons developed what we now call the "select" system, where only those deemed most able would be chosen to join the fyrd. The remainder would stay at work, creating a surplus of provisions and equipment for both the marching army and those left behind in order to sustain the realm and improve the army's chances of victory. In practice, the majority of men were not levied, so many were expected to service the war machine in other practical ways. The fyrd were called upon on many occasions during the years of the Viking invasions, most famously to fight the Norwegian king Harold Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, just weeks before the cataclysmic Saxon defeat at Hastings.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_gastald_guardsmen	In the Lombard kingdom 'gastald' were both civil, judicial and military administrators, responsible for governing the urban parts of the kingdom in the ruler's stead ('reeves' performed the same function in rural areas). Gastald owed their allegiance directly to the king, which caused friction between them and the extremely territorial dukes, who held great sway within the Lombard state and desired to rule autonomously. As royal power within the Lombard kingdom waned, so too did the gastald - their influence being restricted to purely administrative matters. By the beginning of the Medieval age the title had almost entirely disappeared from use, save for officials in the emergent city-states of Milan, Pisa and Venice, in some cases surviving right up to the time of the Napoleonic Wars.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_mar_ger_germanic_transport_crew_long	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods around the Mediterranean, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of Greek settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where Greek ships could reach. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_gastald_swordsmen	The difficulty of obtaining iron in the early Middle Ages, combined with a lack of understanding of how to mass-produce welded weaponry meant that iron-forged blades were the weapons of noblemen who could afford the otherwise-prohibitive cost. Blades in the early Middle Ages were created through a process known as 'pattern welding', where iron rods, twisted together and ground down, formed a soft, carbonised centre for the blade that helped it better absorb the shock of a blow. Around this core, thin iron plates were then 'carburized' (hardened, essentially) onto the blade to give it increased strength. This style of layering metal pieces over each other gave blades a distinctive banding pattern, similar in appearance to the age-rings of a tree trunk.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_van_moorish	The Moors were an ancient Berber people from northern Africa. Known to the Romans as 'Mauri', the province of Mauretania was named for them. Before that, they both traded with and, at times, were 'friends' - clients - of Rome. Yet Mauri history goes back a lot further; they were known to be trading partners of Carthage at the height of the dead city-state's mercantile power. During the 3rd century AD the Mauri even produced two important bishops, one of whom went on to become St Augustine. At the time of the Vandal conquest of Roman Africa many of the Mauri were fully-integrated into Roman society. However, some continued to live in the desert, on the borders of the Roman world and in the tribal manner. Their traditional methods of fighting kept the Vandals from completely subjugating the region, much of which remained in Mauri hands until the Islamic conquest of the 7th century.	true

As a result, most were captured from the coast of Britannia or on the Vikings' forays down the Volga River, where they became known as ‘Slavs’. The men who captured the thralls were known to the Mediterranean peoples as the ‘Rus’ – whose land eventually became Russia - or the ‘Varangians’, who of course served as unbiased Imperial bodyguards in the Byzantine Empire that succeeded the Eastern Romans. The lowest of the low in Nordic society, thralls were pressed into fighting and were often poorly-armed and armoured – the idea behind their use being that they would increase a Nordic army’s size until its opponents were overwhelmed by superior numbers, rather than their skill at arms.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_levy_long	Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, they supplemented the elite professional soldiers. Persian armies, for example, were created by command of the king, who ordered his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and hamspah - or levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order.	true

Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_visigothic_slingers_long	The Visigoths, then known as the Thervingi, emerged from the Gothic confederation of tribes at around the end of the 4th century AD. Having defeating the Romans at Adrianople, they sacked Rome before moving into the west, eventually settling in France and Spain and becoming foederati of the Empire. Like many of the Migration Period peoples, the Visigoths were not a single tribe but rather a confederation of warrior bands united by a single leader. Perhaps the most famous of these was Alaric I, who was responsible for the sack of Rome in AD410. However, his relationship with the Romans was not at all straightforward. Having fought for them in the Balkans, Alaric was appointed Magister Militum for Illyria in AD397. This gave him control of the Illyrian arms factories or fabricae, making it likely that the forces that so successfully attacked Rome used Roman weapons to do it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_lancers_of_the_oasis_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long.

In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_clibanarii_long	'Clibinarii' were the ultimate blunt instrument on late Roman battlefields. Taken from the original Greek 'klibanophoroi', their name means 'camp oven' or 'metallic furnace', probably due to the amount of armour that covered both man and horse. Having faced formidable opposition when fighting Palmyra and Sassanid Persia, the Eastern Romans soon realised that they would have to match their enemies' brutal heavy cavalry attack if they were to make any headway whatsoever in their wars against the eastern empires. Whereas cataphracts were traditionally armed with lances for charging, clibinarii carried all manner of clubs, maces, and axes which enabled them to get in close and literally smash their opponents to pieces in melee. 	true

The disruption of a cattle supply, therefore, could be catastrophic. Cattle Raiding was the source of much of the strife and conflict through Celtic Ireland, and was so prominent that it was featured heavily in early Irish literature, specifically the 'Táin Bó', or Cattle Raiding tales. Though considered fiction, much of the content is based on reality; cattle were the source of lightning raids and larger pitched battles alike. Even the post-raiding customs of taking heads and victory feasts are preserved in the tales, drawn directly from historical accounts.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_afar_raidmasters_long	Referred to as "Han’e" in Ge’ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia, the ‘gile’ is a sickle-like sword. Its curved blade is deadly sharp and was used to strike behind an opponent’s shield at unprotected areas. Unlike the shotel, which it most-closely resembles, both the upper and lower part of the gile's blade is sharpened. As a result, it could be used to slash from side to side or up and down, frequently inflicting mortal wounds in the process. The gile's unusual shape also meant it could be hooked around the top of its bearer’s own shield in order to brace for an incoming charge. Grave goods and art of the period reveals that the sword was popular, and possibly originated, among the northern Ethiopian Afar tribe before spreading across eastern Africa.	true

'Sae wylfling', meaning 'sea wolf cub', are ships named after the proud, mighty warriors who sailed to war with the Norse hero Helgi Hundingsbane. In 1939, the remains of several longships were discovered in Sutton Hoo, East Anglia, as part of the largest intact Anglo-Saxon burial haul found in the United Kingdom. Although their hulls were all worn away, rivets and markings allowed for replicas to be constructed, including what archaeologists believe is an example of a sae wylfing. From the reconstructions we can tell that these ships were fast, with a mast for sailing with the wind, banks of oars for speedy travel with and against it, and a rudder for increased manoeuvrability.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_tribesmen	Though they established a kingdom in the Pannonian Basin, the Avars were chiefly a nomadic people who, as the Middle Ages dawned, were only just embracing the ideas and concepts of the burgeoning European kingdoms. It is widely thought that their westward migration during late antiquity was largely due to the movement of more powerful tribes across the steppes, who were most probably the all-conquering Turks. Therefore, as a people who had travelled from the east to start new lives, their culture was still firmly rooted in hunting and the nomadic way, rather than the settled lives of the 'civilised' western nations. At this time, tribesmen armed with bows still considered themselves the primary providers; men who would fight for their tribe and homes against all comers, rather than rely on any sort of administrative structure to organise their defence. it was this that enabled them to respond quickly to the Slavic incursions of the period, and with some success.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_pictish_black_blades_long	Historical accounts indicate that when Celtic forces fought, and in addition to the use of woad tattoos, they often wielded weapons and wore armour of unusual colours. This must have been particularly alien to the eyes of regimented Romans, when even a second's hesitation on the battlefield could mean the difference between life and death. Indeed, Irish tales from the time speak of warriors with "dark broadgreen javelins", "black, huge swords", and "blackened shields"; this indicates that blades may have been left unpolished and shields tarred for strength and, more importantly, waterproofing against the British weather. The initially unforeseen effect on the Roman invaders was soon turned to an advantage by the wiley Celts, who capitalised on their ferocious appearance, in combination with the element of surprise, to defeat the invaders.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_equites_sagittarii_long	'Equites sagittarii' is Latin for 'horse archers', specialist mounted units armed with bows who served as auxiliary units in the Roman army from the time of Augustus. This, like many adaptations made to the army's original model, was entirely due to contact with the powerful armies of the eastern empires - Parthia and later, Sassanid Persia. Equites sagittarii were, therefore, far more likely to be found serving in the east, where they could match their opponents tactic for tactic in lightning runs and skirmishing. Additionally, the type of glue used in their composite bows would fail in the west due to its predominantly damp climate. Additionally, it was much more difficult to fire a long or self bow from horseback, so javelins were more likely to be used by skirmish cavalry of the Western Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_berber_horsemen	When the Umayyads first conquered the Iberian Peninsula in AD711, they did so under the command of a Berber, Tariq ibn Ziyad, at the direction of the caliph. The Berbers were a collection of diverse people from right across northern Africa who came into contact with Islam during its conquests of the 7th century AD. Although their compliance was hard-won, the Berbers did become a crucial and distinct part of Muslim society, distinguishing themselves rather than simply vanishing into the homogenous mass of subject citizens. They formed significant portions of the "junds", the divisions of the caliphate's army. The Berbers were known particularly for their breed of horse - the 'Barb', renowned for its endurance and strength. The Barb was descended from the Numidian breeds used by Hannibal during the Second Punic War to defeat the Romans at such climactic battles as Cannae, in 216BC. As a result, Berber horsemen were a powerful asset for the Muslim forces stationed in Spain.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_archers	Although the amount of cavalry fielded by the Umayyads increased over time, the numbers remained biased in favour of infantry (and weight of numbers at that) for much of the early Middle Ages. Drawn from the native Andalusian and north African Berber populations, infantrymen had to be proficient in both melee and skirmishing techniques and carried both axes and bows, so their battlefield role could be changed by the general according to the tactical situation with which they were presented. Despite advances in horse archery elsewhere in the world - and particularly in the east - skirmishing remained primarily an infantry role; horse archers were used, but were not a common sight in western Umayyad armies of the period.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_tribespeople_long	These nomadic tribespeople come from the vast steppes to the north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and were known variously as Scythians or Saka, and later the western Sarmatians. Light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide. Such shields could also be scaled with either horn or metal. This type of armour also extended to their clothing at times, with scaled versions of their tunics becoming widespread, especially amongst the steppe nobility. These troops also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting their foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_fyrd_javelinmen	Until very recently, when mechanisation reduced the amount of close-quarters fighting required, skirmishers were used to harass, never giving the enemy pause to regroup and distracting them until melee troops or cavalry could pin them down. In the ancient world, particularly among the 'civilised' states of the Mediterranean, many skirmishers were considered highly skilled, with places such as Crete and the Balearic Islands specialising in producing first class archers, slingers and javelineers. In the north and west of Europe, such weapons were generally thought considered cowardly - only fighting hand-to-hand in melee carried the required amount of honour and glory with it. As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blinded to an infantry or cavalry charge bearing down upon them.	true

Yet in spite of the oath they swore, Roman troops did desert their ranks and, in many cases, found their way into the employ of opposing armies.

Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for younger members to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_band_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces. Brought up on the traditions of feasting and raiding, they craved the opportunity to prove themselves against a worthy enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_axe_band_long	Celtic warriors were ideally equipped to hack through even heavily-armoured foes. Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic troops, the lightly-armoured axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_band_long	While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by the Romans. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle.	true

So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true

The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the early Middle Ages, the Frankish navy was of no real distinction, yet Charlemagne did maintain a sizeable navy to defend against Viking raids, which was something other kingdoms generally failed to do. At the time, the distinction between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_persian_brigade_long	The Persian war machine differed greatly from that of the west. Gone was the reliance on a backbone of columns and infantry; instead, the eastern empires fielded heavy cataphracts, drawn from the nobility, as their main strength. These powerful shock troops were complimented by horse or camel archers, to harry the enemy and keep them under pressure. On foot, the Persians fielded light spearmen levies supported by an elite division of archers to back the cavalry and rain death upon the enemy. Also, the cataphracts were often aided by the hammer-blow of the terrifying elephant corps, upon which great importance was placed due to its magnificent power.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_elite_duguth_spearmen_long	Arguably the first time the 'Saxones' - an aggressive Germanic tribe - was mentioned was by the Egyptian writer Claudius Ptolemy in 'Geographia', during the 2nd century AD. At the time they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia. Over the ensuing years, they settled there in large numbers, eventually becoming known as the 'English' and the place, 'England'.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_umayyad_guard_cav	The Umayyad military was a mixture of traditional Muslim warriors, descended from the Syrian garrisons in Al-Andalus, as well as local Andalusian converts to Islam and Berber people from Africa. Although the elite units were drawn from the Andalusian garrisons, the role of the caliph's personal guard - or 'hasham' - was reserved for the elite of the slave military class - the Mamluks. Right across the caliphate's territory, Mamluks formed the bulk of the armed forces, with status beyond that of a normal slave and even of a free citizen. As the centuries passed, the influence of the Mamluks continued to grow, they began occupying positions of increasing seniority in both the military and civilian administrations, eventually toppling their masters in Egypt during the 13th century to become the sultans of the Bahri dynasty.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_archers	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_saxon_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_himyarite_shotelai_long	The shotel is a thin, broadly circular bladed sword. It is often referred to as a 'sickle sword', a term applied to many similar curved weapons, such as the scimitar, the Persian shamshir and the Egyptian khopesh. Shotelai fought exclusively with the shotel, using the blade's shape to strike around their opponent's shields, penetrating their defences and hitting them in key areas; the kidneys or the lungs were common targets. The blade on a shotel varied from that of a shamshir or a kopesh as it was nearly a full semicircle, making it more awkward for the user to wield. In the hands of an experienced swordsman, however, its potential for death was magnified. 	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_mounted_archers	Invariably, archers had a crucial place in the battle lines of antiquity and the Middle Ages, as if you can kill your enemy from a distance it saves the effort of dealing with them face to face. During their expansion, the Carolingian Franks came into contact with many eastern foes adept at fighting fast, ranged wars from horseback. These interactions evolved the western style of archery, with horses used more and more as time went on. The Avars, for instance, were known to use saddles with raised pommels for greater stability during battle, and there is evidence to suggest that both the Franks and Byzantine Romans adopted this style also. However, some Frankish foot soldiers, such as the Alemans, were known to use yew longbows of up to two metres in length in a similar style to those fielded by the Anglo-Saxons. Yet, whilst these bows were used commonly, they lacked the punch and accuracy of the composite bows of the east.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_gastald_knights	In the Lombard kingdom 'gastald' were both civil, judicial and military administrators, responsible for governing the urban parts of the kingdom in the ruler's stead ('reeves' performed the same function in rural areas). Gastald owed their allegiance directly to the king, which caused friction between them and the extremely territorial dukes, who held great sway within the Lombard state and desired to rule autonomously. As royal power within the Lombard kingdom waned, so too did the gastald - their influence being restricted to purely administrative matters. By the beginning of the Medieval age the title had almost entirely disappeared from use, save for officials in the emergent city-states of Milan, Pisa and Venice, in some cases surviving right up to the time of the Napoleonic Wars.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_skirmishers_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_skirmishers_long	The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young people aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for younger members to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_alani_horsemen_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_ambushers_long	Due to its sound logical reasoning, the ambush remains one of the most ancient and enduring military tactics. Essentially, a surprised enemy, and one who is hopefully surrounded at the time, can be defeated more swiftly and easily. Learned on the hunt, the skills needed to successfully ambush were first tested by early man against the beasts he hunted for food. Some of the most famous ambushes of history demonstrate the form's devastating potential, such as Hannibal's surprise attack on Roman forces at the River Trebia in 218BC and Arminius' resounding victory at the Teutoburg Forest, where his men descended from the forests to cut a Roman Legion to pieces. For the wise military commander, any forest or mountain pass presented an opportunity to lay an ambush or, if not scouted and traversed with sufficient care, to be ambushed.	true

However, over time, ‘tagmata’ came to be known as Constantinople’s elite military garrison. This new form comprised entirely of heavy cavalry, allowing them the mobility to effectively defend a larger radius around the capital, stretching as far as Thrace and Bithynia. In this capacity the tagmata put down several revolts in the eastern provinces. Membership of the tagmata was considered a method of social mobility, as it frequently gave an individual power; proximity to the Emperor meant his attention could be piqued, leading to a court appointment or military command.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_knights	The mounted knights of the Middle Ages have their origins in the 'ordo equester' cohorts of the Roman state cavalry, as well as the privately-funded household cavalry ('bucellarii') of late-period Rome. Being privately funded, the bucellarii were afforded better armour and training than other equestrians, and this focus on training, armour and weaponry was the basis of the emerging knight's skillset. The cataphract horsemen of the east, donned in armour that covered both rider and his powerful steed, were also an influence. In Europe, the Franks bred the 'Barb' horse, a sturdy and hot-blooded north African breed (the name meaning 'Berber') capable of coping with both heavy armour and the punishing demands of warfare. These horses were the tools that allowed Charlemagne's strategy to be realised across Europe. The horsemen, for their efforts, were rewarded with lands and titles. In the centuries following Charlemagne's rule, these men and their descendants went on to solidify their power, evolving into an elite warrior class by the beginning of the Medieval period.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_mounted_skirmishers_long	Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true

The Byzantine Roman scholar Procopius called  them strong, tall, and possessed of a neutral temperament that was "neither cruel nor disrespectful". They reminded him of the Huns and he noted how they mostly went into battle armed but not armoured, decrying any overlords, stating "others do not conquer our lands, we conquer theirs". However, it was centuries later that the foundations of future Slavic states were laid; their culture and ideals remained fairly disparate until that point, with individual tribes working independently of, and oft-times against, each other.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_bows_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_spears_long	While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by the Romans. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle.	true

It is a notable weapon not only for its thick shaft and half-metre blade, but for how it was used. Although menaulatoi were often placed to augment skirmishers, or used to plug gaps between infantry ranks, there are also many instances of their use as shock troops. Menaulatoi would strike out at approaching cavalry, catching them unawares and goring both steed and rider.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_umayyad_guardsmen	The personal guard of the Umayyad caliphs, drawn from the ranks of the mamluk slave army and bolstered by foreign mercenaries, was known as the 'hasham'. Captured beyond the caliphate's eastern borders, beyond Transoxiana, the mamluks (or ghilman) were trained in captivity and freed on appointment to the guard. This was for two reasons; freed slaves owed a debt of duty to their former masters and those from outside the caliphate would be far less likely to intrigue or join an insurrection against it. Mamluk forces became the backbone of Islamic military power in the eastern empire, but the Cordoban caliphs of the west augmented their armies with Berbers and native Andalusians (a mix of native Iberian and Visigothic settlers). The proliferation of mamluk soldiers across the Umayyad Caliphate as peacekeepers contributed greatly to its later destabilisation, as commanders were able to levy their loyal mamluks against both rivals and the central authorities alike.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_savaran_cavalry_long	The Savaran were a wide-ranging cavalry division under the Sassanid Empire, fielding horsemen from light skirmishes and horseback archers to heavy cataphracts. They were generally drawn from nobility, with the highest posts marked for those from the House of Sassan, and those of Parthian descent. They used a variety of weapons; the Parthian spear being the most famous, but also lances, swords, maces and axes. Sassanid cavalry was born out of the need for a highly-mobile military force that could potentially fight a war on two fronts and make use of the eastern steppes, particularly against the infantry-heavy forces of the western powers of the age. 	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_axe_warriors_long	Celtic warriors were ideally equipped to hack through even heavily-armoured foes. Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic troops, the lightly-armoured axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_mavia’s_lancers_long	Mavia, Queen of the Tanukhids, was relatively unknown to history until her legendary revolution against the Roman Empire, succeeding where Zenobia of Palmyra failed 100 years before. Indeed, Mavia is considered by most sources a 'warrior queen', indicating she was recognised primarily by her military deeds which, unusually for the time, made her gender irrelevant. In AD378, three years after the death of her husband, peace dissolved and Mavia began a large offensive campaign against the Romans. Her reasons seem to be religious - Emperor Valens sought to supplant the Tanukhid's Orthodox Christianity with his own brand of Arianism, and so Mavia went to war. She often rode at the head of her armies and struck fast into Roman territory, anticipating Imperial tactics and remaining fluid. As the Tanukhids had no central base of operations, the Romans found it difficult to combat their tactics - appearing as they did to be everywhere and nowhere all at once. Mavia's army bested the Romans in open battle on several occasions, and mercilessly butchered those in its way. In the end Valens capitulated, granting Mavia her demand and naming Moses bishop to the Tanukhid people. Despite her stunning victory, Mavia's glory seems to have lived and died with the war as, after peace was brokered, there is little recorded about the rest of her life.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_lancers	Put simply, a lancer is a cavalryman who excels at heavy impact charges. Although up to that point lancers were usually heavily armoured, during the early Middle Ages they straddled the line between light cavalry and their more heavier counterparts. Knights, a more elite class of western horsemen, were also known to use lances. The romantic image of the knight is that of them jousting one another for sport, entertainment and honour. When charging, the lance was generally tucked (or 'couched') under one arm to improve stability, bracing the entire weight against the rider as he crashed into the enemy. The follow-through power of the lance into a battle line was invariably devastating.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_scholae	Scholae were the successors of the corrupt, abolished Roman Praetorians. They operated above the control of the regular army, answering instead to the state's senior civil officers. Commanded in the field by the ruler himself, scholae were originally recruited exclusively from non-Roman citizens during the time of the Western Empire. Presumably, this was similar to the Ptolemaic Pharaohs' hiring of Galatian Celts as their bodyguards, or future Byzantine Emperors' use of Nordic warriors - the Varangian Guard - to protect them; someone who isn't a citizen, but is on the payroll, is less likely to revolt or engage in subterfuge against the throne.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_onager	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_jinetes	The word 'jinete' translates as 'horseman', although sometimes refers to both horse and rider. Generally deployed in a light cavalry capacity, they were first deployed by Berber tribes such as the Zenata. Switching from camels to horseback, they noticed a sharp increase in the speed and agility they could bring to bear, making them much more manoeuvrable and therefore effective on the battlefield. After facing them in battle and coming off worse, the native Spanish Christians adopted the jinete model, modifying their equipment with swords, shields and javelins to better combat Islamic forces in the region. As the Reconquista gained momentum, more and more jinetes were fielded to face the aggressor, eventually becoming synonymous with Spain instead of the Berbers. Their tactics have been described thus "to swarm around the enemy, to overwhelm him with darts, to draw off if he charged in mass, but to hang upon his flanks and charge him when he grew tired, or fell into disorder".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_noble_skirmishers_long	Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. In the east, for instance, many armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. Those foolish enough to turn and face the threat could be blinded to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_afar_camel_riders_long	Referred to as "Han’e" in Ge’ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia, the ‘gile’ is a sickle-like sword. Its curved blade is deadly sharp and was used to strike behind an opponent’s shield at unprotected areas. Unlike the shotel, which it most-closely resembles, both the upper and lower part of the gile's blade is sharpened. As a result, it could be used to slash from side to side or up and down, frequently inflicting mortal wounds in the process. The gile's unusual shape also meant it could be hooked around the top of its bearer’s own shield in order to brace for an incoming charge. Grave goods and art of the period reveals that the sword was popular, and possibly originated, among the northern Ethiopian Afar tribe before spreading across eastern Africa.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_woodrunners_long	The longsword was a weapon of high worth and status within the Celtic community. A warrior had to prove himself in battle many times before he was permitted to wield one. The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground. On the other hand, since Celtic ironworking was several centuries old, some believe that Roman accounts of this practice mistook this practise, and it was actually a ritual to 'decommission' defeated, dishonoured or damaged weapons.	true

The caliphate did not have the strength to successfully subjugate all corners of its holdings, so the westernmost Berbers remained relatively independent and able to pursue their own goals, including expansion into the Byzantine-controlled Theme of Sicily. The western Umayyad 'jund' - or military divisions - consisted in large part of Berbers, leading the charge into Al-Andalus under the command of Tariq ibn Ziyad.

The wolf is a recurring image in German and Norse mythology, often associated with Wodanaz or Odin, who was the god of victory, amongst other things.

Months prior to embarking on a military campaign the Franks mustered a heerbann, allowing time for them to equip, assemble and train for the conflict ahead. Ignoring a call to join could lead to harsh penalties, although heeding it also had its downsides, as many minor landowners struggled to afford their own armour and weapons.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_skutatoi_axemen	'Skutatoi' is a development of the Latin word 'scutum' - the classic Roman rectangular, curved shield. The evolution of the Eastern Roman army saw the classic Roman infantry model evolve into 'skutatoi'. These men, unlike the privately-owned bucellarii, were professional soldiers, recruited from among loyal citizens who wished to defend their homes and the Emperor. By the 6th century AD, skutatoi were the armoured bulk of the infantry forces of any Roman army, making up two thirds of every 'chiliarchiai' division - the remaining third being archers who supported the melee troops. Armed with the deadly, three metre-long kontarion - based on the kontos lance favoured by cataphracts - some skutatoi were positioned on the front lines to repel cavalry, with their sword-armed counterparts behind them, ready for the melee that followed the initial charge.	true

It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_bejewelled_retinue_long	Whereas German tribes often fought in a more ordered, organised manner than the Celts, they sometimes adopted their neighbours’ weapons and equipment, either through battle or trade. Celtic armour found its way onto the backs of privileged German warriors, while double-edged longswords were another example of creeping Celtic influence. An iron sword was a prestigious possession, so those who carried them were either of noble blood or were veteran followers. By following a noble, warriors were duty-bound to show dedication and valour. If he fell in combat, the noble’s men were expected to fight to the death. Anyone who survived such a battle was disgraced. Some hanged themselves, unable to live with the shame and dishonour of outliving their battle-lord.	true

Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place.

Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_sagittarii_long	From the very beginnings of its Empire, during the time of the Principate, Rome had fielded 'sagittarii' - archers - drawn from its subject peoples as auxiliaries to the Legions. As the centuries wore on, following several sets of reforms, almost all of them were folded into the Roman army proper. In the Western Empire, archers were used in much smaller numbers than other classes of skirmisher, however, possibly due to the composite bows with which they fought; the glue used tended to dissolve in wet western climes and the wood would warp, rendering the weapon entirely useless. It was a much more common sight for units of sagittarii to be attached to Eastern Roman armies as cavalry, where they followed their region' ancient traditions of skirmishing from horseback.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_gothic_levy_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_archers	Most eastern barbarians were raised as hunters, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. On the battlefield, their archers lined up behind other infantry - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them. Massed in large numbers, archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_light_moorish_cavalry_long	The Moors were an ancient Berber people from northern Africa. Known to the Romans as 'Mauri', the province of Mauretania was named for them. Before that, they both traded with and, at times, were 'friends' - clients - of Rome. Yet Mauri history goes back a lot further; they were known to be trading partners of Carthage at the height of the dead city-state's mercantile power. During the 3rd century AD the Mauri even produced two important bishops, one of whom went on to become St Augustine. At the time of the Vandal conquest of Roman Africa many of the Mauri were fully-integrated into Roman society. However, some continued to live in the desert, on the borders of the Roman world and in the tribal manner.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_levy_long	In their heart of hearts, the Germanic peoples were warriors first and foremost. When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_duxs_guard	Dux is Latin for 'leader', and was used to refer to any commander troops. Indeed, Caesar uses it many times throughout his Bello Gallica, but mainly in reference to Celtic generals, as his own men used the formal, political titles particular to the Republic. By the time of the Migration period, however, it had become an official title and the most powerful military position of the time. Dux were the men responsible for entire 'themes' (administrative districts) during the early Middles Ages; the Theme of Sicily - formally under Byzantine Roman control - was run by both a dux and a praetor, who managed military and civilian matters respectively. It appears that over time, however, the dux assumed the role of supreme military governor, managing the province almost entirely with the aim of reclaiming Roman territory on the Italian mainland. in actuality, their attempts to do so variously met with failure.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_slav_ambushers	Due to its sound logical reasoning, the ambush remains one of the most ancient and enduring military tactics. Essentially, a surprised enemy, and one who is hopefully surrounded at the time, can be defeated more swiftly and easily. Learned on the hunt, the skills needed to successfully ambush were first tested by early man against the beasts he hunted for food. Some of the most famous ambushes of history demonstrate the form's devastating potential, such as Hannibal's surprise attack on Roman forces at the River Trebia in 218BC and Arminius' resounding victory at the Teutoburg Forest, where his men descended from the forests to cut a Roman Legion to pieces. For the wise military commander, any forest or mountain pass presented an opportunity to lay an ambush or, if not scouted and traversed with sufficient care, to be ambushed.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_levy_long	The Celtic client system meant that a 'freeman' was given opportunities by the tribal hierarchy. He had to serve the noble classes, but he could also earn prestige in his own right. A freeman inevitably became the follower of an aristocrat, working on the land and raising livestock. However he also had the right to bear arms and fight alongside the nobles during times of war. In combat, a Celt could prove his worth, making a reputation for himself. This system caused an appetite for battle amongst the ambitious lower classes. This did not mean that their armies were ill-disciplined or haphazard: their cavalry used 'trimarcisia', where each rider went into battle with a pair of freeman servants, ready to supply fresh mounts or replace a warrior who fell.	true

As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true

Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_heavy_mel_ft_wr	Liburnians were small, compact galleys, ideal for patrolling the Roman coastlines. They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans. During the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire came under continued attack from increasingly stronger barbarian forces from the north and east. In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_sassanid_onager_large_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_legio_long	Although the Eastern Roman Empire significantly altered its military style from that of its western arm in later centuries, Eastern armies remained relatively similar in the years immediately following the political divide of AD395. The forces of both Roman Empires remained infantry-heavy, with the Legions - 'Legio' - forming the bulk of any Roman army. The Notitia Dignitatum describes how the Legions were divided into units of comitatenses, auxilia, and the elite palatini. These units were broken down further according to their role - 'comitatus praesantales' were Imperial escorts that traditionally remained with the Emperor at the capital, but also fought with him on campaign. Standard comitatenses were deployed as strategic garrisons, and finally limitanei controlled the frontier itself, acting as an early warning system for barbarian incursions.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_alani_mounted_sword_raiders_long	There was no more important element in nomadic armies than the horse. Indeed, it was crucial not only to their strength in battle but also to their survival as a culture. The Sarmatians and Alani kept up to four horses per man, so that each day a fresh horse could be used. The horses they bred, and the men who rode them, were strong and determined, and used their numbers to overwhelm the enemy. Although nomads were known for their skill at horse archery, the Sarmatians and Alans in particular were fond of heavy shock tactics; running down their enemies with sword or lance before they could organise their defence. The nomads' sheer ferocity in battle meant that not only were they a terror to enemy foot soldiers, but contemporary heavy cavalrymen also.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_des_desert_spears_long	The desert is a harsh and unforgiving place, yet it is home to many all the same. The Tuareg, an offshoot of the Berber people, for instance, lived a nomadic life in the Sahara. They travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_avar_horde_long	The Avars were a nomadic people who originated on the northern borders of the Chinese Empire. Derogatively, the Chinese called the Avars ‘Juan Juan’ meaning ‘nasty wriggling insect’, indicating their distaste for the nomadic lifestyle. A personally selected group of professional warriors led by a Khagan, or Khan, the Avars were driven through northern Iran and in to the steppes by the movement of the Huns. Naturally, their environment lent itself to the perfection of horsemanship and eventually many nations, including the Eastern Romans, adopted their cavalry methods. This included the use of special wood-framed saddles, light fitting garments and their stronger, more deadly bow design.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_clubmen	The club is arguably one of the most simple yet effective weapons in history, cave paintings dating its use to at least 6000BC, with variants (batons, truncheons, nightsticks, etc.) still in common usage today. Although primitive, clubs are undeniably effective, as few can deny the potency of blunt-force trauma to the head. Although essentially little more than crude, heavy lumps of wood, their design became more nuanced as the Middle Ages wore on, as warriors grafted strips of metal and spikes onto their weapons to amplify the 'smashing' and 'crunching' for which a club is so effective. As a result, new forms such as the mace, flail and morning star eventually came into being, covered in spikes to pierce armour and rupture bodily organs.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_slav_warriors	The Slavs are first mentioned in Byzantine records of the 6th century AD, referred to as the "Sclaveni and Antae" from beyond the Carpathian mountains. Historians believe that the myriad Slavic tribes originated mostly in Central Europe, possibly from along the southern shores of the Baltic Sea. The Byzantine Roman scholar Procopius called  them strong, tall, and possessed of a neutral temperament that was "neither cruel nor disrespectful". They reminded him of the Huns and he noted how they mostly went into battle armed but not armoured, decrying any overlords stating "others do not conquer our lands, we conquer theirs". Much later, when Samo, a Frankish merchant-turned-warlord ruled the Slavs, he provided them with weapons and  armour to battle the marauding Avars. His unification of the tribes also inadvertently laid the foundation for the Slavic states to come, as he brought their ideals and culture together at the same time.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_bows_long	Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_armenian_spears_long	The Kingdom of Armenia was a crossroads between Persia and Rome, and its military style was influenced by both sides. In late antiquity, Armenian territory was highly contested between the Sassanid and Eastern Roman Empires. Militarily-speaking, its archers were a source of remark, with some sources suggesting they could reliably kill from up to 200 metres. Its cavalry, too, was renowned, and that mountain people could breed such excellent riding stock was often a source of surprise amongst their opponents. Under the Sassanid Empire, Armenian cavalry was honoured as elite, alongside the Savaran, with a position of distinction at the royal capital, Ctesiphon.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_gothic_horsemen	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_archers	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true

One of the histories, which has since become legend, is that of Charlemagne's 'Twelve Peers' - also known as the 'Paladins'. These men were the best fighters in the king's entourage and the vanguard of Christian forces in the struggle against the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate. Their participation in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in AD778, and its subsequent romanticisation in the 11th century "Song of Roland", transformed the image of the Paladins into a valorous, noble class of men considered the very pinnacle of knighthood and therefore a major influence on the chivalric Medieval knights who were to follow.	true

Their nomadic nature meant that there were many Tuareg clans that very rarely interacted. When they did, it was not uncommon to hold camel races, which implying proficient camel control - something that could easily be applied to war. The most famous Tuareg is Tin Hanan, which means 'she of the tents' but can be inferred to be 'mother of the tribe'. She was buried in a monumental tomb in the Sahara desert.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_des_desert_bowmen_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true

As the barbarian kingdoms inhabited the cities and infrastructure of the old Roman Empire, they also used much of its military and civil administration, for the sake of practical convenience. This included some military structure; the comitatenses continued to be led by a 'comte', the root of the noble title ‘count’ - itself a Latinised version of 'companion' in reference to Alexander the Great's friends and compatriots.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_noble_al_rahrain_long	Very few easterners were professional soldiers and none, save for the noble-born cavalry, were formally trained or drilled. Instead, troops were levied by rich landowners as an obligation during times of war. For instance, levied infantry were typically untrained spearmen, with archers and slingers the more experienced and elite foot units. As might be expected due to the local terrain, cavalry was an important component in an eastern army, and several styles of horseback warfare emerged as a result. Horse archers were used to wear down infantry with fast, incessant attacks before and after thunder-strike cavalry charges from the fearsome heavy shock cavalry that was beginning to dominate the battlefield. Melee or spear infantry's main purpose was to pin the enemy down whilst the cavalry carried out complex its outflanking manoeuvres, which naturally affected the quality of troops employed for the role.	true

Zafar's position was advantageous, placed as it was along important trade routes, as well as on the highest point in Arabia, made it an ideal location to build an economically strong, easily defensible capital city. There is evidence that Zafar was besieged by the Aksumites in the 3rd century AD, but successfully defended itself against the African invaders.

At the time they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia. Over the ensuing years, they settled there in large numbers, eventually becoming known as the 'English' and the place, 'England'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_mounted_swordsmen	The difficulty of obtaining iron in the early Middle Ages, combined with a lack of understanding of how to mass-produce welded weaponry meant that iron-forged blades were the weapons of noblemen who could afford the otherwise-prohibitive cost. Blades in the early Middle Ages were created through a process known as 'pattern welding', where iron rods, twisted together and ground down, formed a soft, carbonised centre for the blade that helped it better absorb the shock of a blow. Around this core, thin iron plates were then 'carburized' (hardened, essentially) onto the blade to give it increased strength. This style of layering metal pieces over each other gave blades a distinctive banding pattern, similar in appearance to the age-rings of a tree trunk.	true

Worked into a rage before combat, possibly through the use of drugs, they had little protection but were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade and indeed any blow that came their way. At the time, berserkers were thought to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria. However, their intended victims did not have the luxury of considering the opponent that stood before them; berserkers fought with a reckless fury, making them very uncompromising opponents to face, and to slay a berserker was thought a most impressive act of courage.	true

Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react.

Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies.

Perun lives above, in the sky, and is depicted as fiery and dry - diametrically opposed to Veles and his damp, dark corners of the earth. In Slavic mythology, the two fought one another - Perun hurling lightning from the sky and chasing down his opponent. This concept of lightning storms as manifestations of Perun's power was extremely important to the Slavs, in a similar way as it was in many other pantheons - notably, the Greek thunder god Zeus, and the Nordic Thor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_levy_long	These nomadic tribespeople come from the vast steppes to the north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and were known variously as Scythians or Saka, and later the western Sarmatians. Light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide. Such shields could also be scaled with either horn or metal. This type of armour also extended to their clothing at times, with scaled versions of their tunics becoming widespread, especially amongst the steppe nobility. These troops also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting their foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one.	true

When it came to skirmishers 'funditores', Latin for 'slingers', were recruited to accompany its Legions on campaign as early as the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC. The best slingers in the western Mediterranean came from the Balearic islands, where it is said that children had to 'sling for their dinners' - having to knock their bread from a wall at range before being permitted to eat by their parents. In the eastern Mediterranean, the rocky crags of islands such as Crete produced fine skirmishers, be they slingers, javelineers or archers. During Imperial Rome's almost constant wars against the eastern empires local skirmishers were drafted into fight, honouring the long-standing traditions of their inhospitable homelands and enabling the Romans to 'level the playing field' in terms of army structure and tactics.	true

Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_raid_leader_long	The group of Norsemen who became known as ‘Vikings’ referred specifically to the seafarers who raided those lands bordering the North Sea, particularly the sparsely-defended Britannic coasts. Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true

The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_archers	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_alani_nobles_general_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_screaming_women_long	Unlike their 'civilised' counterparts, barbarian women had power within their societies, and were not to be crossed. On the battlefield, they tended the wounded, brought supplies forward, and inspired courage. With a strong sense of personal honour, they called down the gods' curses and swore vengeance on anyone who wronged them. Although without formal positions in tribal politics, in some societies a woman could still inherit the influence of her husband or father, and this could be used to take terrible vengeance. Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni from eastern Britannia, is a prime example of a powerful woman - the revolt she started threatened to drive the Romans from Britain altogether.	true

In a military context, there is speculation as to their exact use within the war machine of first the Roman Empire and later the Ostrogoths, but it is known that at least during times of emergency, iuvenes were drafted into military operations from 'collegia iuvenum' - literally 'youth clubs' - which concentrated on physical exercise and military training. Following the fall of Western Rome, iuvenes continued to be drafted to fight alongside the regular army during times of war.

It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_bows_long	The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, they had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant they often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_sarmatian_cataphracts_infantry_destroyer_tier_5_long	The axe became more and more prevalent due to its effectiveness in penetrating the heavier types of armour beginning to come into use during late antiquity. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, could be used to pull aside or split shields, and were effective against plate or chainmail armour as, even if it didn't find the optimum angle to split it, a blow could still shatter bones and crush the organs beneath. One-handed axes may have been the most practical to carry and use, but two-handed axes were also common - the bearer requiring great upper-body strength to pick the weapon up and swing it repeatedly in combat. Nomadic warriors such as the Sarmatians sometimes wielded the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting their foot archers and cavalry, their role was simply to protect the former from the latter.  	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_bows_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_bows_long	The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young people aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for younger members to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_berber_light_cav	When the Umayyads first conquered the Iberian Peninsula in AD711, they did so under the command of a Berber, Tariq ibn Ziyad, at the direction of the caliph. The Berbers were a collection of diverse people from right across northern Africa who came into contact with Islam during its conquests of the 7th century AD. Although their compliance was hard-won, the Berbers did become a crucial and distinct part of Muslim society, distinguishing themselves rather than simply vanishing into the homogenous mass of subject citizens. They formed significant portions of the "junds", the divisions of the caliphate's army. The Berbers were known particularly for their breed of horse - the 'Barb', renowned for its endurance and strength. The Barb was descended from the Numidian breeds used by Hannibal during the Second Punic War to defeat the Romans at such climactic battles as Cannae, in 216BC. As a result, Berber horsemen were a powerful asset for the Muslim forces stationed in Spain.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_elite_nordic_spearmen_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_alani_chosen_raiders_long	Nomadic melee or shock cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreated before the enemy could effectively counter-attack. Although mounted troops were terrifying and effective as shock cavalry, charging down enemy lines and wreaking havoc, they also performed another, equally important function on the battlefield. Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horsemen made excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen for their main hosts, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_desert_bowmen_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_scout_equites_long	Since Rome's beginnings, as was common in almost all ancient societies, the noble class were the only people who could afford horses, and were therefore most likely to own one. As a result, early Roman armies fielded cavalry consisting entirely of nobles - the equestrian class - and then bolstered their comparatively small numbers with units formed from the city's Italian Socii allies. Due to a number of high profile defeats, such as their poor showing during Hannibal's climactic Italian campaign at the end of the 3rd century BC, Roman cavalry contingents were generally considered to be far weaker than their Italian counterparts whilst purely a unit of nobles. Eventually the Socii were granted Roman citizenship and, following a number of reforms to the army's structure, were folded into its ranks. Wherever the Romans went after that they drew on local specialists to swell their numbers as auxiliary troops. By the time of the Hunnic incursions, auxiliaries had been made a part of the Legions, resulting in Rome being able to field some of the best, most adaptable cavalry in the ancient world.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_ras_guard_long	As in the vast majority of the warrior-led societies of antiquity, one of the key responsibilities of Aksum’s kings – and in fact the very reason the dynasty was successful – was to undertake military operations to increase their territory or consolidate their powerbase at home. Indeed, most stelae of the time concerned themselves with the reporting of successful campaigns to put down rebellions, extract tribute, or deal with marauders who threatened the security of the kingdom. This is certainly due to Aksum’s (common for the time) policy of encouraging home rule within its dependencies, which frequently led to the overlord’s strength being tested whenever an old king died or a new one succeeded. The quality of Aksum’s armed forces was key to the continued success of its monarchs, so it made sense to be closely involved with their structure at all levels. As such, the king – retaining the rank of commander-in-chief - installed close members of his family to lead campaigns when he was distracted elsewhere. His trusted brothers, son, nephews, and cousins – given the title ‘Ras’, meaning “prince” – were considered far less likely to revolt than ambitious career generals, disgruntled with their lots or hungry for advancement. Bizarrely, this sometimes meant that Aksumite generals were children too young to fight who had to be accompanied by loyal, experienced officers to physically carry out the king’s orders. Under the Aksumite system, this preserved the royal family’s status, ensuring it was always given credit for the victory.	true

Known for their fierceness, Dailamite men were employed by the Sassanid Empire as high-quality infantry during the wars of late antiquity. At the end of this period, when the Rashidun Caliphate swept through the east, the stalwart Dailamites successfully resisted the Arab conquest from the Alborz, becoming known as the Muslims’ most perfidious enemy.

The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia.

The Sarmatians were always horse archers, but their cavalry gradually adopted heavier and heavier armour as the centuries passed, eventually wearing as much armour as the famed cataphracts of the east.

Therefore, in the name of variety, eastern cavalry took many forms. As a result short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers were all used, but the primary, most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_slingers	The sling is one of the oldest ranged weapons in existence, possibly dating back to before the Neolithic period. Its use throughout history is evidenced by depictions upon Assyrian and Egyptian reliefs, as well as those of later times, such as Trajan's Column and the Bayeux Tapestry. A sling is essentially a length of material (usually leather, but sometimes stretched pig bladder) with a cradle in the centre to hold a stone. The slinger then holds the ends and spins the sling to generate momentum. By extending his arm and simultaneously increasing the force of the spin, then releasing the stone at the precise moment, the slingshot can be flung a large distance - far greater than would be possible without it. Many young people grew up throwing stones found on the river beds of Europe, giving them a natural advantage when applying the skill to combat. Rocks and stones were in ready supply so, whilst spears may have needed repair after a battle, slingers were always well provisioned. Often people of low status in society, and therefore in battle, slingers would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, providing a blanket of slingshots to hamper the enemy when charging. In return, the veterans would use their shields to safeguard the slingers as they unleashed their missiles. Slingshot could be an effective weapon against close enemy formations or cavalry.	true

The Notitia Dignitatum describes how the Legions were divided into units of comitatenses, auxilia, and the elite palatini. These units were broken down further according to their role - 'comitatus praesantales' were Imperial escorts that traditionally remained with the Emperor at the capital, but also fought with him on campaign. Standard comitatenses were deployed as strategic garrisons, and finally limitanei controlled the frontier itself, acting as an early warning system for barbarian incursions.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sagena	The 'sagena' - meaning 'arrow' - and its smaller cousin the 'kondura' were the vessels of choice of the Narentine pirates, Slavic pagans who switched fishing for piracy and the slave trade during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Probably based on the Nordic drakkar, these ships were long, slender and shallow, which made them considerably faster than the opposition. The sagena could carry up to forty warriors and the kondura half that number. The ability to outrun the Byzantine Roman authorities, coupled with their capture of Papal emissaries on their way to Constantinople in AD870, intimidated them to the point where Emperor Constantine VII ordered a large amount for use in his own fleets. The most famous example to be discovered is the so-called 'Condura Croatica', found buried in the town of Nin in 1966, and dated to the 14th century - indicating that the kondura and sagena were hardy and effective enough to remain in production for many centuries.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_shield_archers_long	Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_sagittarii	From the very beginnings of its Empire, during the time of the Principate, Rome had fielded 'sagittarii' - archers - drawn from its subject peoples as auxiliaries to the Legions. As the centuries wore on, following several sets of reforms, almost all of them were folded into the Roman army proper. In the Western Empire, archers were used in much smaller numbers than other classes of skirmisher, however, possibly due to the composite bows with which they fought; the glue used tended to dissolve in wet western climes and the wood would warp, rendering the weapon entirely useless. It was a much more common sight for units of sagittarii to be attached to Eastern Roman armies as cavalry, where they followed their region' ancient traditions of skirmishing from horseback.	true

Although technically a barbarian incursion which they at first resisted, Rome eventually recognised the new Frankish kingdom in around AD357. In return, many Franks fought alongside the Roman army as foederati after that date. Observing the Franks, the Roman historian Sidonius Apollinaris spoke of a love of fighting bred into their young from an early age, stating "it is their sport to send axes hurling through the vast void and know beforehand where the blow will fall, to whirl their shields, to outstrip with leaps and bounds the spears they have hurled, and reach the enemy first".	true

Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_dbl_art_cel	Small rowing boats were useful for fishing and small-scale military actions, enabling troops to silently row ashore and surprise the enemy. In the northern part of Celtic Britain, the most common form of boat for such uses was a small vessel of leather skins stretched over and bound to a wooden frame. Known by various names depending on its makers country of origin, it was generally called a 'currach' or 'curragh' in Ireland or Scotland, but sometimes 'naomhog' - literally 'little female saint' - or 'canoe' in the west of the country. In Wales, the Isle of Man, and along the northwestern coasts of England the same boat was known as a 'coracle'. Larger versions were also constructed, using planks but otherwise following the same methods and known as 'curach adhmaid' or 'bad iomartha', which mean, somewhat unimaginatively, 'wooden currach' and 'rowing boat' respectively.	true

Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect.

Whilst a noble may have been trained in how to use a bow as a hunting weapon, the standard freeman would not have had such training, unless he were a forest-dweller, where hunting was crucial to survival. Those who were, however, used the longbow that became common amongst the northwestern European peoples. Made of yew or ash, with bowstrings of looped and corded linen, longbows were superior to smaller varieties, particularly in Britain, where English and Welsh longbowmen became renowned for their skill in later centuries.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_dbl_art_ger	Liburnians were small, compact galleys, ideal for patrolling the Roman coastlines. They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans. During the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire came under continued attack from increasingly stronger barbarian forces from the north and east. In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_heavy_mis_sco_eas	The word 'dromon' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes. At the very minimum a dromon had a crew of 200; 50 men to the lower bank of oars, 100 on the oars above, and 50 combat marines. It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram. Some were reported to carry pipe-like weapons used to project Greek Fire onto enemy ships.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_spear_band	The spear has been around almost as long as people have, having been employed for hunting and fishing long before war. A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. The spear was the most commonly-used weapon through antiquity and remained so into the Middle Ages; elite warriors had the time to learn and master the polearm, yet the common man could also be taught the basics of handling one in battle in short space of time. Unearthed Saxon spears have broad heads with wings along the blade to stop enemy swords and spears travelling down it, whereas others are thinner and longer to allow for deeper penetration when stabbing opponents. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall. Most spearmen of the period also carried a shield to provide additional defence and make spear or shield walls, which were virtually impenetrable and particularly effective against cavalry charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_contarii_long	Although the Roman Empire was responsible for countless military advances during its tenure, it couldn’t realistically claim to be responsible for them all. The cataphracts of Parthia – the shock cavalry of the ancient age, armoured from head-to-toe and wielding lances - devastated the Legions at Carrhae in 53BC and again at Nisibis in AD217. This, in combination with the increasing number of incursions by steppe nomads, who also fielded heavy lancers, caused the Roman army to begin modelling its own tactics around similarly heavy cavalry. Thus were formed the 'equites catafractarii' in several variants to fulfil specific functions on the battlefield, such as clibinarii and contarii, heavy horsemen armed with lances. The lance used was a deadly weapon; known as a ‘contus’, it was a long, thrusting spear that probably required the use of both hands. To wield such a weapon whilst simultaneously handling a horse on the charge must have taken great skill, proving that contarii were exceptional mounted soldiers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_noble_suebi_swordsmen_long	The Suebi were not a single tribe, but a collection of many smaller groupings sharing a language, gods, and an abiding interest in raiding their neighbours across the Rhine. This interest in warfare is important, however, as it is through warfare that Suebi warriors earned fame and notoriety. While kings and chiefs were often members of elite or ‘noble’ families, their positions were elected; success in war was a good way of attaining and keeping power within the tribes. This need for glory and to be seen doing mighty deeds might also explain the most distinctive feature of a Suebi’s appearance: his hair. To distinguish themselves from their slaves, Suebi freemen and warriors sported a topknot that added to their height and fearsome appearance. For kings, chiefs and champions, this ‘Suebian Knot’ was even more elaborate than usual. That way, the doer of great deeds would be clearly visible on the battlefield. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_mar_nom_nomadic_transport_crew_long	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods around the Mediterranean, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of Greek settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where Greek ships could reach. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true

Al-Hira was said to be a paradise on earth, but more importantly was a Sassanid asset outside of Arabia. As Sassanid clients, they rendered military service to their overlords, as well as taking a political role - even helping the Emperor Bahram V seize the throne in AD420.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_young_wolves_long	The concept of the wolf warrior has many origins in ancient barbarian Europe. Multiple cultures, including Indo-Europeans and even Native Americans, claim kinship with the wolf's tenacious, outcast nature. The Alamans inhabited this notion through their warrior king, Hroc the Elder, in the same way that Beowulf's warriors embodied the boar in legend. The Langobards also fielded wolf warriors who were much more closely connected to their religion and, in particular, their chief god Godan (also known as Odin). The 'dance' of Godan was performed by tribal elders, who channelled the god and instilled their warriors with skill and courage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_exculcatores_long	Exculcatores' were ranged infantry units that operated as part of the Auxilia Palatina - Legions of auxiliaries created during Constantine the Great's military reforms of the early 4th century AD. They were formed of local troops, and often took the names of the tribes from which they were drafted. As auxiliaries, it is safe to assume that exculcatores operated along the frontiers, stationed in Gaul or Britannia. Although there is reference to their acting as standard javelinmen, the Notitia Dignitatum contains some evidence that exculcatores were specialist units, used for tracking in conjunction with another scouting corps known as 'exploratores'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nom_steppe_lancers_long	Developed from the cavalry skills of their ancestors, steppe lancers were a type of heavy cavalry. They wore scale armour to protect themselves and their mounts, and used a long lance known as a kontos, which enabled them to deliver devastating charges in a fashion comparable to the deadly cataphract cavalry from the east. Their scale armour was made from horn, or later metal, and allowed its wearers to easily run down their western counterparts. However, lancers were still vulnerable to dense pike or spear-armed formations. Archery provided a solution: sustained volleys from skirmishing foot and horse archers were used to thin and spread out the enemy prior to a devastating, thunderous charge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_royal_persian_archers_long	Massed in large numbers, eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_light_moorish_cavalry_long	The Moors were an ancient Berber people from northern Africa. Known to the Romans as 'Mauri', the province of Mauretania was named for them. Before that, they both traded with and, at times, were 'friends' - clients - of Rome. Yet Mauri history goes back a lot further; they were known to be trading partners of Carthage at the height of the dead city-state's mercantile power. During the 3rd century AD the Mauri even produced two important bishops, one of whom went on to become St Augustine. At the time of the Vandal conquest of Roman Africa many of the Mauri were fully-integrated into Roman society. However, some continued to live in the desert, on the borders of the Roman world and in the tribal manner. Their traditional methods of fighting kept the Vandals from completely subjugating the region, much of which remained in Mauri hands until the Islamic conquest of the 7th century.	true

From Philip of Macedon's Somatophylakes or the Roman Praetorian Guard to the Mongolian Kheshig or the Forbidden Troops of Tang Dynasty China, the very best military men have always defended their leaders. The proximity that royal guards had to their rulers often meant that the political power they wielded was amplified to the point that crises would often be determined by which side the royal defenders backed; if they stayed loyal, then the leadership often survived, but if they defected, the ruler would be supplanted in favour of a candidate of their choosing, if not one of their own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_cel_sword_band	Originally a rare weapon of quite some prestige, the sword became more common in the early Middle Ages, with blades produced on a larger scale to more standardised specifications. The spatha of the Roman period became the basis of Viking and Carolingian longswords. These single-handed blades, with triangular pommels and short grips, were widely used, not only by the Viking Danes but right across Europe. Swords during the era were chiefly produced by the Franks and obtained by the Danes through either trade or, as is more likely, raiding, pillaging and looting of Frankish possessions. Although they were all of a roughly similar length, there were variances of several inches as, although they were more speedily produced, mass-production of arms and armour, and the standardisation and quality control that went with it, was still a rarity at that time.	true

Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horses were excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen force for their main host, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks. More nimble melee cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreating before the enemy could effectively counter-attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_camel_lancers_long	The eastern nations eschewed columns of infantry in favour of a dominant cavalry force able to outmanoeuvre and harass infantry on their native plains. Therefore, in the name of variety, eastern cavalry took many forms. As a result short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers were all used, but the primary, most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could even skewer two men at once.	true

They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_frankish_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true

They are thought to be directly descended from the Zenata, the ancient father-tribe to most Berbers throughout antiquity. The Aures Mountains allowed the Shawia lands and peoples to become a consolidation point for resistance to Roman control, as well as later resisting the Vandals and Arabs.

Essentially an infantry unit of comitatenses used to patrol the Empire's frontlines, rather than remaining in one place along the frontier and defending that position. There is some question regarding the precise meaning of armigeri as a troop class, but the word itself refers to their heavier armour. There is also the possibility that it was an honorary, distinguishing title, earned through victory and acts of valour in battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_noble_alani_cavalry_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true

Nobles could also recruit their own following, building both reputation and influence through their clients, but proving their worth in battle was the start. Without bravery in a potential leader, no freeman would follow. A man's future, if he lived, was therefore entirely dependent on his showing in battle, and this led to bravery being a commonplace occurrence. Like their elders, Celtic youths were not above goading their opponents with insults and taunts, and they used 'carnyx' battle horns to instil fear in their foes. Inexperience, as with all young men, led them to sometimes act rashly where a little caution might have served them better.	true

When not fighting, they were seeking out the next fight. Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces.

They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_gallowglass_long	Gallowglasses were the super-soldiers of the Celtic world, well-trained heavy infantry skilled in the use of all manner of weapons - swords, spears, javelins, bows, darts – as well as the Celtic martial arts. To be a gallowglass one had to be of mixed blood – descended from the union of a settled Nordic raider and a Celtic woman. When Nordic raiders, who harried the coasts of Scotland and Ireland during the Dark Ages, eventually settled and interbred, the offspring of such unions were known as ‘Gael-gall’ – literally “foreigners who speak Gaelic”. In Ireland the word ‘Galloglaich’ - pronounced ‘Gallowglass’ – was used to explicitly refer to a “young, foreign warrior”. As has often been the case throughout history, this mixed blood separated gallowglasses from the hierarchy of the Celtic clan system. As such, they had little loyalty to the old order and many became soldiers for hire to the highest bidder. Although technically under the sovereignty of the Norwegian king during this time, many gallowglasses served Scottish rulers or settled in Ireland, where they were more easily accepted, integrating with the native population at all societal levels.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_mar_est_eastern_boatmen_long	Naval warfare in the ancient world was just another way for infantry to fight one another. The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight. The distinction, then, in antiquity, between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_slav_peruns_axes_long	During the 1st century AD, the eastern Slavs worshipped a pantheon of five gods known as the 'Quintheism'. These gods held dominion over different aspects of the world (the sun, the sky, the earth etc.). At the head of this pantheon was Perun, a thunder god who wielded an enormous axe (or sometimes a hammer) that returned to his hand when summoned. It is clear that Perun shares similarities with the thunder god Zeus, head of the classical Greek pantheon, as well as Thor and his hammer Mjolnir. Perun was above all other gods - the Slavs declared him the "creator of lightning" and "the only lord of all". In order to invoke his divine protection, his worshippers carved hexagonal symbols known as 'gromoviti znaci' onto the beams and foundations of their homes in the hope that Perun would protect them from lightning storms. Like several gods from other cultures, Perun seems to be derived from 'Perkwunos', a widely worshipped Indo-European thunder god. From Perkwunos comes the Thracian god 'Perkon' and the Hittite god 'Pirwa', as well as the Greek work for 'thunderbolt', 'karaunos'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_scattershot_hurlers_long	The young people of the Germanic tribes grew up throwing the stones found on the river beds of northern Europe, giving them a natural advantage when applying the skill to combat. Rocks and stones were in ready supply so, whilst spears may have needed repair after a battle, slingers were always well provisioned. Poor people of low status, both in society and subsequently in battle, they would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, protecting them from enemy attacks. In return, the veterans would use their shields to safeguard those behind them as they unleashed their rain of missiles. Slingshot could be an effective weapon against close enemy formations or cavalry.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cor_heavy_rom	Corbita were large merchant ships used by the Romans to transport a wide range of trade goods across their vast empire. Ostia was one of the most important ports in ancient Rome, just fifteen miles from the capital at the mouth of the River Tiber. Enabling the swift transfer of goods into the heart of Rome itself, this proximity to the capital made it an ideal target for the enemies of the empire. Alaric the Goth's capture of the port in AD409 was instrumental in the downfall of the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_heavy_mis_sco_ger	The word 'dromon' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes. At the very minimum a dromon had a crew of 200; 50 men to the lower bank of oars, 100 on the oars above, and 50 combat marines. It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram. Some were reported to carry pipe-like weapons used to project Greek Fire onto enemy ships.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_sarmatian_shock_tier_4_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_saxon_mounted_warband_long	Arguably the first time the 'Saxones' - an aggressive Germanic tribe - was mentioned was by the Egyptian writer Claudius Ptolemy in 'Geographia', during the 2nd century AD. At the time they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia. Over the ensuing years, they settled there in large numbers, eventually becoming known as the 'English' and the place, 'England'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_protectores_defectors_long	Punishment in the Roman Army was severe, even for minor crimes. An act of desertion - treason in the eyes of the Senate - brought with it even more brutal punishments, such as being placed in a sack filled with snakes and tossed into a river. Yet in spite of the oath they swore, Roman troops did desert their ranks and, in many cases, found their way into the employ of opposing armies. More often than not, these soldiers came from conquered Imperial territory, breaking away from an overlord they didn't believe in to fight for their homeland.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_clibanarii	'Clibinarii' were the ultimate blunt instrument on late Roman battlefields. Taken from the original Greek 'klibanophoroi', their name means 'camp oven' or 'metallic furnace', probably due to the amount of armour that covered both man and horse. Having faced formidable opposition when fighting Palmyra and Sassanid Persia, the Eastern Romans soon realised that they would have to match their enemies' brutal heavy cavalry attack if they were to make any headway whatsoever in their wars against the eastern empires. Whereas cataphracts were traditionally armed with lances for charging, clibinarii carried all manner of clubs, maces, and axes which enabled them to get in close and literally smash their opponents to pieces in melee. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_grey_hair_long	The Alani, or Alans, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alani's talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alani were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_mounted_bows_long	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_devil_archers_long	The Huns terrorised the people of Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, striking fear in to the hearts of even the bravest men. Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_persian_scouts_long	The Persian war machine differed greatly from that of the west. Gone was the reliance on a backbone of columns and infantry; instead, the eastern empires fielded heavy cataphracts, drawn from the nobility, as their main strength. These powerful shock troops were complimented by horse or camel archers, to harry the enemy and keep them under pressure. On foot, the Persians fielded light spearmen levies supported by an elite division of archers to back the cavalry and rain death upon the enemy. Also, the cataphracts were often aided by the hammer-blow of the terrifying elephant corps, upon which great importance was placed due to its magnificent power.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_kerns_long	Although the word ‘ceithern’ - pronounced ‘kern’ – simply refers to a group of fighters, they were one of two essential components of later Celtic Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, kerns were very much designed to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles kerns filled very much depended on the needs of their clan. Although their stock-in-trade was the execution of surprise skirmish attacks, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, kerns occasionally engaged in melee and could easily run down fleeing routers. On the battlefield kerns wore a light leather coat, rather than the heavy chainmail favoured by the gallowglasses, which ensured unrestricted movement. They also carried a variety of missiles, often sporting darts but also slings and javelins on occasion.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_housecarls	The Scandinavian housecarls or huscarls were professional, trained soldiers in service to a lord or king - the word literally meaning 'household man' or, more crudely put, 'manservant'. They were retainers to their lord or king - his personal bodyguard who fought close to and protected him on the battlefield in the same way as the 'hearth friends' of old Celtic and Germanic 'barbarian' Europe. Relics of the time now unearthed, such as the Turinge Stone, carry inscriptions calling these men the "best in the land", again reinforcing their elite status. Following the conquest of much of central and northern England by the Danes during the 10th century, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies. As such, they famously defeated their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and held the line at Hastings, protecting King Harold's body to the very last man.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_noble_foederati_javelinmen_long	Not quite allies in the traditional sense, but not strictly part of the Empire either, foederati were tribal groups living just outside the borders of Roman territory who were bound by treaty to provide military support. In return, they received subsidies from the Romans, usually food. At varying times the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Alans and even the Huns fought for Rome as foederati. The main problem with the foederati system was that constituent tribes tended to become unreliable over time, especially after a change of leader. Famously, the Goths became foederati of the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens but then rebelled, utterly defeating his army and killing him at Adrianople in AD378. In turn, the loss of a large part of Rome’s standing army resulted in greater reliance on foederati troops, which ultimately hastened the end of the Western Empire. As Imperial authority weakened, and pressure from the marauding steppe nomads increased, many foederati moved inside Roman provinces. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_dbl_art_slav_long	The 'sagena' - meaning 'arrow' - and its smaller cousin the 'kondura' were the vessels of choice of the Narentine pirates, Slavic pagans who switched fishing for piracy and the slave trade during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Probably based on the Nordic drakkar, these ships were long, slender and shallow, which made them considerably faster than the opposition. The sagena could carry up to forty warriors and the kondura half that number. The ability to outrun the Byzantine Roman authorities, coupled with their capture of Papal emissaries on their way to Constantinople in AD870, intimidated them to the point where Emperor Constantine VII ordered a large amount for use in his own fleets. The most famous example to be discovered is the so-called 'Condura Croatica', found buried in the town of Nin in 1966, and dated to the 14th century - indicating that the kondura and sagena were hardy and effective enough to remain in production for many centuries.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_slav_archers	Most eastern barbarians were raised as hunters, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. On the battlefield, their archers lined up behind other infantry - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them. Massed in large numbers, archers could inflict heavy casualties, and the composite bows they carried afford them greater range, accuracy and power than many of their western counterparts. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or ‘self’ bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina, it demanded respect, care and attention to use well. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_dbl_art_rom	Liburnians were small, compact galleys, ideal for patrolling the Roman coastlines. They were named after an Illyrian tribe who used similar vessels during their raids against the Romans. During the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire came under continued attack from increasingly stronger barbarian forces from the north and east. In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes. By AD477 the Vandals had all but wiped out the Roman navy to take complete control of the Mediterranean, after which time the western sea was known as Wendelsae, or ‘Sea of the Vandals'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_lom_guardsmen	As long as there have been kings and queens, there has been an elite cadre of men charged with defending them. From Philip of Macedon's Somatophylakes or the Roman Praetorian Guard to the Mongolian Kheshig or the Forbidden Troops of Tang Dynasty China, the very best military men have always defended their leaders. The proximity that royal guards had to their rulers often meant that the political power they wielded was amplified to the point that crises would often be determined by which side the royal defenders backed; if they stayed loyal, then the leadership often survived, but if they defected, the ruler would be supplanted in favour of a candidate of their choosing, if not one of their own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_nordic_mounted_raiders_long	The group of Norsemen who became known as ‘Vikings’ referred specifically to the seafarers who raided those lands bordering the North Sea, particularly the sparsely-defended Britannic coasts. Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_guardsmen	Charles Martel transformed the Frankish army into a powerhouse capable of stopping even the seemingly unstoppable: the deadly forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, who had already conquered Spain and had designs on Francia also. He created a structured military that his grandson, Charlemagne, inherited and expanded upon. Although the Frankish people were called to war by a summons known as 'bannum' - and all sections of the populace were expected to serve in some way - professional, standing armies still existed. These were the personal forces of the noble class drawn from their estates, known as 'exercitus' and the permanent guards who served in the palaces of Austrasia - the ancestral seat of Carolingian power - known as 'pfalz' (literally 'palace' in Frankish).	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_beher’s_chosen_long	The shotel is a thin, broadly circular bladed sword. It is often referred to as a 'sickle sword', a term applied to many similar curved weapons, such as the scimitar, the Persian shamshir and the Egyptian khopesh. Shotelai fought exclusively with the shotel, using the blade's shape to strike around their opponent's shields, penetrating their defences and hitting them in key areas; the kidneys or the lungs were common targets. The blade on a shotel varied from that of a shamshir or a kopesh as it was nearly a full semicircle, making it more awkward for the user to wield. In the hands of an experienced swordsman, however, its potential for death was magnified. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_pap_guardsmen	In AD768, when Stephen III was elected Pope during a period of political instability, Byzantine Roman soldiers were in attendance in order to discourage subterfuge and the open violence that had broken out between the candidates. After the ceremony, Stephen was escorted to the Lateran Palace under military protection, whilst throughout Rome his supporters began viciously attacking his opponents. Rather than being a powerless observer, it is thought that Stephen revelled in the destruction of his rivals; Constantine - his rival or 'anti-Pope' - was first beaten and imprisoned, then left in the street to die whilst his bishop had his tongue removed. Clearly, the Papal States were developing into a vicious, power-hungry, absolute monarchy. As a result, the Pope needed constant protection from enemies both within and without and most candidates ruled for only a few short years.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_mavia’s_chargers_long	Mavia, Queen of the Tanukhids, was relatively unknown to history until her legendary revolution against the Roman Empire, succeeding where Zenobia of Palmyra failed 100 years before. Indeed, Mavia is considered by most sources a 'warrior queen', indicating she was recognised primarily by her military deeds which, unusually for the time, made her gender irrelevant. In AD378, three years after the death of her husband, peace dissolved and Mavia began a large offensive campaign against the Romans. Her reasons seem to be religious - Emperor Valens sought to supplant the Tanukhid's Orthodox Christianity with his own brand of Arianism, and so Mavia went to war. She often rode at the head of her armies and struck fast into Roman territory, anticipating Imperial tactics and remaining fluid. As the Tanukhids had no central base of operations, the Romans found it difficult to combat their tactics - appearing as they did to be everywhere and nowhere all at once. Mavia's army bested the Romans in open battle on several occasions, and mercilessly butchered those in its way. In the end Valens capitulated, granting Mavia her demand and naming Moses bishop to the Tanukhid people. Despite her stunning victory, Mavia's glory seems to have lived and died with the war as, after peace was brokered, there is little recorded about the rest of her life.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_bosphoran_infantry_long	The Bosporan Kingdom was a client of the Roman Empire. It outlasted all others, only briefly becoming a province under the Emperor Nero. Located in Crimea, on the shores of the Cimmerian Bosporus, its prosperous territory was originally a Greek colony. A large amount of archaeological evidence has since been uncovered there, including gold work, imported goods and textile fragments. The remains of the city of Panticapaeum, which was built on Mount Mithridat, still stand today, despite being hit by an earthquake in 70BC and sacked by the Huns in AD370. This is largely due to a revival during the Roman period that saw these great cities protected and incorporated into new fortresses.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_seax_band	In Old English, the word 'seax' simply means 'knife'. Specifically, the seax is a dagger, usually made of iron, with a single edge. It was commonly used by the Saxon tribes from at least the Migration Period into the early Middle Ages - and is in fact the etymological root of the tribe's name, used by the Romans to differentiate one 'barbarian' enemy from another. There were many types of seax, with differences in length and breadth but retaining basic design of a wooden hilt into which the blade is fitted. Used for hunting as well as battle, one of the most famous examples is the 'Seax of Beagnoth', discovered in the riverbed of the River Thames in southern England and named for its owner, whose name is inscribed along the blade. Beagnoth also inscribed the runic alphabet along the blade, notably making distinct errors in the transcription and messily rectifying his mistake.	true

The disruption of a cattle supply, therefore, could be catastrophic. Cattle Raiding was the source of much of the strife and conflict through Celtic Ireland, and was so prominent that it was featured heavily in early Irish literature, specifically the 'Táin Bó', or Cattle Raiding tales. Though considered fiction, much of the content is based on reality; cattle were the source of lightning raids and larger pitched battles alike. Even the post-raiding customs of taking heads and victory feasts are preserved in the tales, drawn directly from historical accounts.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_skutatoi	'Skutatoi' is a development of the Latin word 'scutum' - the classic Roman rectangular, curved shield. The evolution of the Eastern Roman army saw the classic Roman infantry model evolve into 'skutatoi'. These men, unlike the privately-owned bucellarii, were professional soldiers, recruited from among loyal citizens who wished to defend their homes and the Emperor. By the 6th century AD, skutatoi were the armoured bulk of the infantry forces of any Roman army, making up two thirds of every 'chiliarchiai' division - the remaining third being archers who supported the melee troops. Armed with the deadly, three metre-long kontarion - based on the kontos lance favoured by cataphracts - some skutatoi were positioned on the front lines to repel cavalry, with their sword-armed counterparts behind them, ready for the melee that followed the initial charge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_mar_est_eastern_transport_crew_long	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods around the Mediterranean, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of Greek settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where Greek ships could reach. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_chnodomar's_raiders_long	Chnodomar was a king of the Alamans during the 4th century AD, and considered one of the most senior among their tribal confederation at the time. He led the Alamans against the Roman Empire several times in a bid to settle further west, away from the advancing nomad hordes. His army clashed with the Roman usurper Magnetius and defeated him in AD352 before the revolt was crushed and his brother was forced to commit suicide. This led directly to the Alaman's most famous, but ill-fated battle at Strasbourg in AD357 where, despite ingenious tactics, they were roundly defeated and pushed back across the Rhine. Chnodomar himself was taken prisoner and died in Rome of disease shortly afterwards.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_veterans	In the Ostrogothic Kingdom, much like the Roman Empire it replaced, veteran soldiers who had completed their service could be asked to come back in times of need. Usually affiliated to their old commander, they were afforded great respect and honour because of their previous service. As examples to the common soldier, they were often immediately promoted and given a pay rise. Crucially, veterans were exempt from many of the mundane and laborious tasks of army life such as digging latrines, building roads and making camp.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_armoured_archers	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_noble_archers_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_bucellarii	After the 'Imperial Crisis' of the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire found itself with no public policing, and so the administration of peace and justice in the cities became a military matter - for palatinae and the myriad Imperial guards. On the outskirts and in the more affluent rural countryside, wealthy landowners maintained peace through specially-hired private soldiers, known as bucellarii. 'Bucellarii' translates as 'dry biscuit eater', because of the rations they were provided. Private funding meant that they were generally better equipped and skilled than regular troops, and the added incentive of private payment also kept them performing at their best. Bucellarii were required to take an oath not only to their private employer, but also to the Emperor, to ensure no conflicts of loyalty. Belisarius employed up to 7,000 bucellarii during his conquests, though by this time the term had come to mean, more broadly, well-equipped cavalrymen.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_gothic_falxmen_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_legio_comitatenses_long	Although the Eastern Roman Empire significantly altered its military style from that of its western arm in later centuries, Eastern armies remained relatively similar in the years immediately following the political divide of AD395. The forces of both Roman Empires remained infantry-heavy, with the Legions - 'Legio' - forming the bulk of any Roman army. The Notitia Dignitatum describes how the Legions were divided into units of comitatenses, auxilia, and the elite palatini. These units were broken down further according to their role - 'comitatus praesantales' were Imperial escorts that traditionally remained with the Emperor at the capital, but also fought with him on campaign. Standard comitatenses were deployed as strategic garrisons, and finally limitanei controlled the frontier itself, acting as an early warning system for barbarian incursions.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_lanciarii_seniores_long	A 'lancea' was a spear equally useful for throwing as thrusting; it is the word from which we get the English word 'lance'. First noted during the destructive civil wars of the Tetrarchy, 'lanciarii' were reserve troops who fought for the Roman Emperor. Although details of their regimental origins remain unclear, it is likely that lanciarii were specially trained in its use. However, there is some evidence that they were armed with lighter throwing javelins during the 2nd century AD, giving rise to the theory that the title simply referred to any Roman soldiers who fulfilled a skirmishing function on the battlefield. In the Eastern Roman Empire, 'lanciarii seniores' were veterans under the direct command of the Magister Militum, the equivalent of Field Marshal or Generalissimo in modern terms, where they became guards to the Emperor following the dissolution of the treacherous praetorians. In this capacity, lanciarii may even have fought on horseback around that time, although there is no mention of mounted units in later sources.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_armoured_sagittarii_long	From the very beginnings of its Empire, during the time of the Principate, Rome had fielded 'sagittarii' - archers - drawn from its subject peoples as auxiliaries to the Legions. As the centuries wore on, following several sets of reforms, almost all of them were folded into the Roman army proper. In the Western Empire, archers were used in much smaller numbers than other classes of skirmisher, however, possibly due to the composite bows with which they fought; the glue used tended to dissolve in wet western climes and the wood would warp, rendering the weapon entirely useless. It was a much more common sight for units of sagittarii to be attached to Eastern Roman armies as cavalry, where they followed their region' ancient traditions of skirmishing from horseback.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_savaran_cataphracts_long	The Savaran were a wide-ranging cavalry division under the Sassanid Empire, fielding horsemen from light skirmishes and horseback archers to heavy cataphracts. They were generally drawn from nobility, with the highest posts marked for those from the House of Sassan, and those of Parthian descent. They used a variety of weapons; the Parthian spear being the most famous, but also lances, swords, maces and axes. Sassanid cavalry was born out of the need for a highly-mobile military force that could potentially fight a war on two fronts and make use of the eastern steppes, particularly against the infantry-heavy forces of the western powers of the age. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_bre_armorican_knights	The westernmost tip of France, what we now call Brittany, was once known as Armorica, from the Gaulish phrase "are-mori" - "on the sea". It was an area of determined resistance to Roman rule throughout antiquity, and in the 5th century AD, as the Western Empire collapsed, migrating Britons were able to establish themselves in the region. These people, fiercely proud of their identity - having migrated to preserve it - provided a haven for those displaced by the collapse of Rome and the horrors of the migrating hordes. The Frankish Merovingian kings, in the late 7th century AD, created a line of fortresses and defences along the border with Armorica, known as the "Breton March". This and other marches were administered by wardens to the crown, who were charged with observing, guarding and defending the kingdom against potential incursion. Clearly, the Merovingians (and later the Frankish kings) found the presence of the Armorican Bretons a cause for vigilance.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_scout_cav	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_rumha_skirmishers_long	The javelin is among the oldest weapons in the world. Equipped with javelins and little else, skirmishers harried both their opposite numbers and more tightly-packed melee infantry, peppering them before quickly retreating. This was the typical tactic of all unarmoured, javelin-armed troops of the age: to appear as if from nowhere, rain fire down on the enemy, and then retreat back into the terrain. Such harassment could be highly effective, particularly on the vast plains of the desert kingdoms, where a mobile, almost guerrilla style of warfare worked better than the regimented Roman battle lines that had conquered the west. The desert peoples saw war as a way of life - historical sources have very little information about their large scale battles, but often mention them as raiders in search of loot. In lightning fast raids, skirmish tactics using the javelin, alongside heavy cavalry, would have been vital to achieving a swift victory.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_lakhmid_scouts_long	The Lakhmids were clients to the Sassanid Kings. Originating in Yemen, on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, they settled and ruled from Al-Hira, in what eventually became central Iraq. Al-Hira was said to be a paradise on earth, but more importantly was a Sassanid asset outside of Arabia. As Sassanid clients, they rendered military service to their overlords, as well as taking a political role - even helping the Emperor Bahram V seize the throne in AD420. The Lakhmids also fought against the Eastern Romans throughout the 4th century alongside the Sassanids, who offered religious tolerance and freedom from Roman Orthodox Christianity.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_levis_armaturae	'Levis armaturae' literally translates as 'lightly armoured'. These flexible, sparsely-clad infantry formed a large part of late Roman armies, acting primarily as a skirmishing force. They were used to harass the enemy and hurled slingshot, javelins and plumbatae - deadly lead darts - before falling back through the maniples of heavy infantry as they advanced. They could then continue skirmishing on the enemy's flanks. In this way, levis armaturae never gave the enemy pause to regroup or breathe; successful skirmishers maintained a defensive screen as an army manoeuvred, able to keep pressure on the enemy and an eye on their own flanks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_castle_dromont	The word 'dromont' is derived from the Greek word ‘dromao’, which means ‘to run’, and was applied to light, swift vessels built in a variety of forms and sizes. At the very minimum a dromon had a crew of 200; 50 men to the lower bank of oars, 100 on the oars above, and 50 combat marines. It is thought that lateen sails were used rather than square ones, and that for some reason it was armed with a spur at the bow of the ship, rather than a ram. Some were reported to carry pipe-like weapons used to project Greek Fire onto enemy ships.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_comitatensis_spears_long	In the face of an increasing number of barbarian incursions, the effective defence of Rome’s now-sprawling territory became a serious problem in the 4th century AD. The Emperor Constantine’s controversial solution was to divide the army into two halves. 'Comitatenses' were the late-Roman equivalent of the traditional Legionaries, designed to swoop in and decisively defeat enemy forces already pinned down by 'limitanei', the frontier garrison troops tasked with guarding the 'limes' - the borderlands of the Empire. Although originally intended to be the Emperor’s own elite palace guard, the Empire’s increasingly difficult border situation led to comitatenses becoming Rome’s main field armies. Led by a 'comte', the root of the noble title ‘count’ - itself a Latinised version of 'companion' in reference to Alexander's friends and compatriots - comitatenses were professional soldiers every bit as dangerous as their Legionary forebears.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_hunnic_mounted_bows_long	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_gothic_pikemen_long	A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years. However, around AD370, clashes with the Sarmatians, Alans and other steppe peoples, all under pressure from the newly-arrived, marauding Huns, turned the Goths into refugees, once again bringing them into conflict with the Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_rebellion_militia_long	Mavia, Queen of the Tanukhids, was relatively unknown to history until her legendary revolution against the Roman Empire, succeeding where Zenobia of Palmyra failed 100 years before. Indeed, Mavia is considered by most sources a 'warrior queen', indicating she was recognised primarily by her military deeds which, unusually for the time, made her gender irrelevant. In AD378, three years after the death of her husband, peace dissolved and Mavia began a large offensive campaign against the Romans. Her reasons seem to be religious - Emperor Valens sought to supplant the Tanukhid's Orthodox Christianity with his own brand of Arianism, and so Mavia went to war. She often rode at the head of her armies and struck fast into Roman territory, anticipating Imperial tactics and remaining fluid. As the Tanukhids had no central base of operations, the Romans found it difficult to combat their tactics - appearing as they did to be everywhere and nowhere all at once. Mavia's army bested the Romans in open battle on several occasions, and mercilessly butchered those in its way. In the end Valens capitulated, granting Mavia her demand and naming Moses bishop to the Tanukhid people. Despite her stunning victory, Mavia's glory seems to have lived and died with the war as, after peace was brokered, there is little recorded about the rest of her life.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_skirm_cav	Like other former barbarian kingdoms, the Franks inherited much of the Roman Empire's military and societal structure, not just its territory. Once again, cavalry was an aristocratic division as only wealthy landowners could afford horses and therefore provide cavalry during times of war. Elite cavalry, by extension, was drawn only from the most highly-skilled among them. They, more than any other, could afford not only the horse, but the mail and plate armour required; 'brunia' body armour was the single most expensive piece of military equipment of the age, costing more than the horse itself. Some took this to excess, adorning their armour with jewels and other finery, but Charlemagne was known to have criticised his noblemen for such ostentatious displays. In battle, Carolingian cavalry favoured a mass charge of spears to break the enemy quickly. This worked particularly well on favourable, flat terrain but led to problems on less-than-ideal topography. In fact, cavalry was still considered inferior until long after the Battle of Tours when, due to a failure in mobilisation, Charles Martel won the battle without any heavy horse at all. Standard Frankish horsemen were lightly armoured (wearing little more than padded cloth), carried spears and shields, and were best-suited for bringing home a cavalry charge and then, once involved in the fray, remaining to press the attack.	true

During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_royal_suebi_cavalry_long	The Suebi were not a single tribe, but a collection of many smaller groupings sharing a language, gods, and an abiding interest in raiding their neighbours across the Rhine. This interest in warfare is important, however, as it is through warfare that Suebi warriors earned fame and notoriety. While kings and chiefs were often members of elite or ‘noble’ families, their positions were elected; success in war was a good way of attaining and keeping power within the tribes. This need for glory and to be seen doing mighty deeds might also explain the most distinctive feature of a Suebi’s appearance: his hair. To distinguish themselves from their slaves, Suebi freemen and warriors sported a topknot that added to their height and fearsome appearance. For kings, chiefs and champions, this ‘Suebian Knot’ was even more elaborate than usual. That way, the doer of great deeds would be clearly visible on the battlefield. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_gen_guard_cav	As long as there have been kings and queens, there has been an elite cadre of men charged with defending them. From Philip of Macedon's Somatophylakes or the Roman Praetorian Guard to the Mongolian Kheshig or the Forbidden Troops of Tang Dynasty China, the very best military men have always defended their leaders. The proximity that royal guards had to their rulers often meant that the political power they wielded was amplified to the point that crises would often be determined by which side the royal defenders backed; if they stayed loyal, then the leadership often survived, but if they defected, the ruler would be supplanted in favour of a candidate of their choosing, if not one of their own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_noble_gothic_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true

The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_germanic_hunters_long	The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, they had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant they often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_germanic_pikes_long	Once use of the pike in battle had spread to the west, it was adopted by many of the barbarian tribes. As an extension of the popular 'shield wall' formation, emergent barbarian pike tactics had similarities to the phalanx combat of the Greek city-states and the Macedonian pike reforms that won half the world for Alexander the Great. However, tribal pike troops fought far more defensively than the Greeks, especially with the advent of heavy cavalry such as lancers and their supplanting of the more traditional barbarian infantry charge with brutal shock tactics. Gradually, pikes became a popular defensive choice all over northern Europe; the Norsemen used them in a similar, circular formation of around 1,000 men in a tightly-packed mass, designed to stop enemy cavalry charges dead in their tracks. This also likely gave rise to the later ‘schiltron’ or ‘shield troop’ formation commonly used by Scottish medieval armies.	true

Whilst this translates simply as 'artillery', the existence of crossbow (then known as manuballistae) units in such large numbers, as recorded in the Notitia, indicates that balistarii referred to crossbow-armed foot soldiers, rather than full-size ballistae and their crews. Whilst many types were developed in ancient times, Roman crossbows bore similarities to later Medieval weapons, rather than being modelled on the Greek gastraphete. Operated by inserting the bolt and pulling it into place using a lever or crank, more torsion was created than a human could achieve without aid. The bolt, when released, fired with much more power than an arrow, and was therefore able to penetrate much thicker armour.	true

The Tuareg, an offshoot of the Berber people, for instance, lived a nomadic life in the Sahara. They travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_garamantian_hunters_long	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_elite_nubian_archers_long	Nubian archers from the ‘Land of the Bow’ were famed for their skills and used as mercenaries by the Ptolemaic dynasty. Archery was valued in Nubian society: their gods and rulers were often depicted with bows or archer’s thumb rings, and their warriors were buried with bows, quivers, arrows and rings. The rings allowed archers to fully draw their powerful bows, as the shaped metal ring guarded their fingers. Several types of bow were employed, including the longbow and composite bow. There were also many types of arrowhead, some of which were barbed to make them more difficult to remove from a wound.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_garamantian_lancers_long	The Garamantians were a Saharan people who created an empire based on the slave trade and used a sophisticated network of irrigation tunnels for their water supplies. This vital water supported cattle and wheat farming, enabling the Garamantians to dominate much of Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa. At times, this expansion threatened Carthage and Ptolemaic Egypt, who also prized their fierce warriors as mercenaries. A reliance on slaves and freemen of low birth, much like the Spartans, enabled the Garamantians to develop a skilled military elite famed for their horsemanship and four-horse chariots. Unfortunately, as the water ran out, so did the fortunes of the Garamantians. Unable to support their towns and territories, their military power dwindled - they could no longer get the slaves they needed to secure more water.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_javelinmen	Until very recently, when mechanisation reduced the amount of close-quarters fighting required, skirmishers were used to harass, never giving the enemy pause to regroup and distracting them until melee troops or cavalry could pin them down. In the ancient world, particularly among the 'civilised' states of the Mediterranean, many skirmishers were considered highly skilled, with places such as Crete and the Balearic Islands specialising in producing first class archers, slingers and javelineers. In the north and west of Europe, such weapons were generally thought considered cowardly - only fighting hand-to-hand in melee carried the required amount of honour and glory with it. As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blinded to an infantry or cavalry charge bearing down upon them.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_nor_nordic_brigade_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_almaqah’s_lancers_long	Almaqah was both moon and sun god in Sabaean culture. He is recognised widely as a protector, defending his people - the "Children of Almaqah" - and depicted with a cluster of lightning bolts and a scythe-like weapon. Although generally considered a god of the moon, Almaqah is also the male counterpart to the Mesopotamian sun god, Shamash, which makes him a sun deity as well. His sacred animal was the bull, although he was also known as the "Lord of the Ibex" - the wild mountain goats being another sacred animal in the Arabian polytheistic pantheon. It seems Almaqah's influence was not merely confined to Arabia - it was also felt much further afield; there is evidence for temples dedicated to him as far west as Yeha and Addi Akawehm in the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray. According to steles found elsewhere in Tigray, Yeha's Temple of Almaqah was the central place of worship for the entire region.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_cataphracts_long	Eastern cavalry had Hellenic and Persian influences, with the more eastern states favouring the cataphract - heavy armour that protected both the rider and horse. The cataphract has its origins early in antiquity, in what is now Iran. Cataphract cavalry was designed to be a hammer in the tactical toolbox of eastern generals, penetrating enemy formations before outflanking and exploiting the resultant chaos. This was helped by the use of the wedge formation to smash through enemy lines. The Sassanids famously fielded the 'Zhayedan', a force of 10,000 strong cataphract riders, as shock troops to quickly and effectively decimate their opponents.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_onager_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_light_mel_sco_er	The dromonarion was smaller and lighter than the dromon and was ideal for patrolling the mouths of rivers. Following the Battle of Actium, where Augustus defeated Marc Anthony and Cleopatra to become First Citizen and de facto Emperor, the Roman navy favoured lighter, more manoeuvrable ships over the larger warships used by the Greeks. This was because of the types of duties they were expected to perform; tasks such as escorting the grain ships from Egypt, suppression of piracy, and river patrols. By this time, large ships were no longer required as there were few naval powers who remained large enough to pose a threat to the new Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_rom_foederati	Not quite allies in the traditional sense, but not strictly part of the Empire either, foederati were tribal groups living just outside the borders of Roman territory who were bound by treaty to provide military support. In return, they received subsidies from the Romans, usually food. At varying times the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Alani and even the Huns fought for Rome as foederati. The main problem with the foederati system was that constituent tribes tended to become unreliable over time, especially after a change of leader. Famously, the Goths became foederati of the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens but then rebelled, utterly defeating his army and killing him at Adrianople in AD378. In turn, the loss of a large part of Rome’s standing army resulted in greater reliance on foederati troops, which ultimately hastened the end of the Western Empire. As Imperial authority weakened, and pressure from the marauding steppe nomads increased, many foederati moved inside Roman provinces. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_sarmatian_mounted_skirmishers_long	The Sarmatians were a steppe people, possibly of Iranian origin, who, following the migrations of the 4th century AD, dwelled along the Danube frontier. Their skill in horsemanship was highly developed, some even crediting them with the invention of the metal stirrup and spur. Today, our knowledge of the Sarmatians is largely due to their burial customs. The Kuban region of southern Russia contains some of the most elaborate Sarmatian tombs, and finds often included a fine array of weapons, metalwork and jewellery that provide a great deal of information about their day to day lives. Full suits of cataphract-style scale armour made for women indicate that female Sarmatians were just as deadly as their male counterparts; it is thought that unmarried women were allowed to ride into battle alongside the men, possibly giving rise to the Greek myth of the Amazons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_camel_archers_long	Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly, and are generally less nervous. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. Also, when faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to back away from fights. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made controlling them considerably easier and conveyed another advantage; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick off targets with some ease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_royal_saiones_long	Originally migrating from the Baltic coast, the Goths settled in the Black Sea area but fragmented once their population outgrew the capacity of the region's natural resources. Following the departure of the Tervingi to the west, the Greuthungi continued to live in the area until pressure from Hunnic incursions, around AD370, caused a large part of the remaining population to migrate south into the Balkans and, crucially, Roman territory. Those left behind eventually became clients of the Huns, alternately rebelling and fighting for them in the west, notably at Chalons in AD451. Following the collapse of the Hunnic powerbase mid-way through the 5th century AD, with the Roman Empire in the west soon to follow, the surviving Greuthungi moved down into the Balkans, becoming known as the 'Ostrogoths' - literally 'Goths of the Rising Sun' or 'Eastern Goths'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_bosphoran_warriors_long	The Bosporan Kingdom was a client of the Roman Empire. It outlasted all others, only briefly becoming a province under the Emperor Nero. Located in Crimea, on the shores of the Cimmerian Bosporus, its prosperous territory was originally a Greek colony. A large amount of archaeological evidence has since been uncovered there, including gold work, imported goods and textile fragments. The remains of the city of Panticapaeum, which was built on Mount Mithridat, still stand today, despite being hit by an earthquake in 70BC and sacked by the Huns in AD370. This is largely due to a revival during the Roman period that saw these great cities protected and incorporated into new fortresses.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_kuyl	The findings at Sutton Hoo in 1939 represent some of the largest and most important discoveries of Saxon material ever unearthed. In particular, the discovery of a 27 metre-long ship, dated approximately to the 7th century AD, gives us one of the clearest ideas of the period. A vessel of that length would presumably have been used for both war and trade, although the discovery was a burial ship, dragged uphill from the river with a hold so bursting with treasure it had broken its keel. Saxon ships of the time did have sails for travelling with favourable winds, but always carried banks of oars for better manoeuvrability during combat or to stay close to the coastline.	true

It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users. Those brave enough to try could create a sheet of flame that rapidly consumed any ships it touched.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_noble_javelinmen	Until very recently, when mechanisation reduced the amount of close-quarters fighting required, skirmishers were used to harass, never giving the enemy pause to regroup and distracting them until melee troops or cavalry could pin them down. In the ancient world, particularly among the 'civilised' states of the Mediterranean, many skirmishers were considered highly skilled, with places such as Crete and the Balearic Islands specialising in producing first class archers, slingers and javelineers. In the north and west of Europe, such weapons were generally thought considered cowardly - only fighting hand-to-hand in melee carried the required amount of honour and glory with it. As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, and tribal society subsided to the more hierarchical feudal system, good skirmishers were highly valued once again. Aside from the longbow, the javelin remained their favoured weapon, particularly when fighting from horseback; a rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blinded to an infantry or cavalry charge bearing down upon them.	true

They roamed this region as they pleased, and had a fierce reputation as cavalrymen almost without equal. They were feared by the Greeks, and often worked as mercenaries or allied themselves to the Dacians. The Sarmatians were always horse archers, but their cavalry gradually adopted heavier and heavier armour as the centuries passed, eventually wearing as much armour as the famed cataphracts of the east. Even the horses wore full suits of scale armour. The riders kept their fearsome bows, even as they became magnificent shock cavalry. With each man carrying a kontos, a long two-handed lance, they could smash through almost any enemy foolish enough to stand against them. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_wh_guardians_of_the_hindu_kush_long	The original stronghold of the Hephthalites was on the slopes of the Hindu Kush, the mountain range situated in modern Afghanistan. This often bleak land moulded the White Huns into the ferocious warriors that went on to conquer large parts of central Asia. . It was during the reign of Khingila that the White Huns came into extensive contact with the Indian Gupta Empire, and even adopted some of its weapon designs. Two such examples are the khanda - the famous Sikh sword - and the fenestrated axe, which came into use further via trade connections along the Silk Route. The khanda has a blunt point but an extremely sharp blade, being designed to slash rather than stab like the Roman gladius. The fenestrated axe has apertures on the blade, thought to increase streamlining as it cuts through the air. It is easy to see why both caught on outside India - they could pierce most common types of armour more effectively than a sword or spear. As a result, well-preserved examples have been found in graves right across the western world.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_comes_long	Rome’s Empire became so large that in its later period the Emperor could not be everywhere at once. As such he appointed ‘Comites’, trusted, high-ranking military and administrative figures who ran certain parts of the Empire in his stead. ‘Comes’ – the singular - is Latin for ‘Companion’, used here in direct reference to the Companions of Alexander the Great, the most trusted lieutenants of the greatest military leader the world had yet seen (and someone all Roman Emperors aspired to be like). The Comites were the Emperor’s own inner circle, the leading officials of the Empire, wielding posts of myriad descriptions and reasonability, from the ‘Comes Britanniarum’, who was in charge of Roman Britain’s defence, to the ‘Comes Sacrae Vestis’ – master of the Emperor’s wardrobe!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_hearth_cav	The Saxon hearth companion was similar in many ways to the thegns of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. As a personal friend of the king, he protected his lord on the battlefield, and in return the king bestowed gifts, titles, lands and power. The very name 'hearth' friend or companion implies closeness to the king, eating and sharing his company around the fire, through which great bonds of friendship and loyalty were made. When not at war, hearth companions were the closest thing to a local police force - enforcing the king's will and administering justice within the provinces they governed on his behalf.	true

Poor people of low status, both in society and subsequently in battle, they would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, protecting them from enemy attacks.

Unlike the ‘Black Huns’ of the north, the Uars had fair complexions and their aristocracy bedecked themselves in fine clothes and jewellery. Their main stronghold, Tokharistan, was situated on the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush Mountains. By the 5th century AD the Uars had succeeded in expanding their territory as far south as India, although that situation was to be short lived.

Although useful for screening infantry and scouting ahead, they were also used to counter horsemen, due to the natural aversion of horses to the smell of camels. Due to their geographical location dromedarii were peculiar to the Eastern Romans, providing a useful indigenous cavalry force for fighting along their frontier with Sassanid Persia.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_germanic_crossbowmen_long	By the time of the Migration Period the crossbow was commonly used in the west, it having been a battlefield fixture for several centuries elsewhere in the world. Although developed independently by the Chinese, some 5th century BC examples have been discovered in Greece, where the western version was probably invented. Certainly by 300BC handheld crossbows began to appear, and it wasn’t long after that the Romans fielded their large torsion-sprung scorpion and ballista bolt throwers for the first time. Although not mentioned by name, by the 2nd century AD the Romans were training cavalry to use handheld, repeating crossbows on the battlefield, their use being recorded by Arrian in his ‘Tactica’. Eventually, the crossbow reached the barbarian tribal confederations of northern and western Europe, where it was used in deadly combination with the pike tactics emerging at that time, also becoming a popular hunting weapon for centuries to come.	true

In the north, the Picts and the Scots raided Britain, the Saxons plundered from the north and in the east, the Goths appeared in ever-more-vast numbers  from the Black Sea region, due to pressure from nomadic tribes from the Steppes.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_javelinmen	The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young people aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling warrior first had to prove their worth before earning the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, they hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness.

They didn't stop there. Eventually, Vandal activity in the Mediterranean became so great that the Romans lost control of the sea and many of its islands, including Sicily. Following several Roman attempts to recapture their lost territories the Vandals invaded Italy, where they became the second of the Germanic barbarian peoples to sack Rome during the 5th century - bringing the city to its knees in AD455. This led directly to an attempted invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire, repelled by the Maniots - once the Spartans of legend - and resulting in the Vandals' expulsion from Greece. Eventually, the Romans gave up trying to destroy them, and the two co-existed uneasily until the Western Empire's collapse around AD476.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_scola_cav	The mounted knights of the Middle Ages have their origins in the 'ordo equester' cohorts of the Roman state cavalry, as well as the privately-funded household cavalry ('bucellarii') of late-period Rome. Being privately funded, the bucellarii were afforded better armour and training than other equestrians, and this focus on training, armour and weaponry was the basis of the emerging knight's skillset. The cataphract horsemen of the east, donned in armour that covered both rider and his powerful steed, were also an influence. In Europe, the Franks bred the 'Barb' horse, a sturdy and hot-blooded north African breed (the name meaning 'Berber') capable of coping with both heavy armour and the punishing demands of warfare. These horses were the tools that allowed Charlemagne's strategy to be realised across Europe. The horsemen, for their efforts, were rewarded with lands and titles. In the centuries following Charlemagne's rule, these men and their descendants went on to solidify their power, evolving into an elite warrior class by the beginning of the Medieval period.	true

The stirrup increased the endurance, manoeuvrability and speed of the horse and reduced its rider's fatigue as the animal was easier to control; this, along with advances in armour technology, meant cavalry – now as heavy as the eastern cataphracts of antiquity - once again became a fixture on the battlefield.	true

Despite advances in horse archery elsewhere in the world - and particularly in the east - skirmishing remained primarily an infantry role; horse archers were used, but were not a common sight in western Umayyad armies of the period.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_axe_warriors_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_archers_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true

The Emperor Constantine’s controversial solution was to divide the army into two halves. 'Limitanei', literally ‘the men on the limes’ or 'borders', were frontier garrison troops intended to pin down an invading force until the full-time 'comitatenses', the late-Roman equivalent of the traditional Legionaries, could arrive to deal with the situation decisively. Although well-equipped, limitanei were generally considered by all to be second-class warriors.

Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack.

The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react.

A versatile weapon, it could be held in either one or both hands and used for thrusting in melee, throwing during skirmishes, or braced in formation to stop cavalry charges. In Africa and the eastern deserts, there were few changes to the spear's design over the ensuing millennia other than advances in metal work (iron replacing bronze tips). For instance, the most popular African spear type, still used by Zulu hunters, remains the ‘assegai’, which is intentionally light-weight so it can be either thrusted or thrown, depending on the situation its bearer finds himself in. Naturally, the development of heavy cavalry led to longer, heavier variants (the lance) and then to pikes – which could be braced to unseat horsemen or massed to create an almost impenetrable wall.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_nordic_spear_masters_long	The term ‘Norsemen’, meaning ‘people of the North’, refers to the Germanic peoples who still inhabit the central part of Scandinavia today. Like all successful tribal groups, the Nordic peoples were extremely warlike and developed strong naval skills alongside raiding tactics based on the traditional barbarian headlong charge. So successful were they, that their race emerged from the Dark Ages to dominate not just their homelands, but many other places - as far afield as Greenland and Russia. As early as the 4th century AD, Norse skill in battle, and their mastery of the waves, was well known - along with an insatiable lust for blood and plunder! Of course, this approach made them very rich; not just tools for battle, their weapons carried just as much meaning as status symbols. The amount of detail on a sword was a sign of wealth, and many examples decorated with precious metals and intricate patterns have been discovered at Norse burial sites.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_des_desert_hurlers_long	Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_celtic_warband_long	The longsword was a weapon of high worth and status within the Celtic community. A warrior had to prove himself in battle many times before he was permitted to wield one. The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground. On the other hand, since Celtic ironworking was several centuries old, some believe that Roman accounts of this practice mistook this practise, and it was actually a ritual to 'decommission' defeated, dishonoured or damaged weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_followers_of_morigan_long	The Morrigan – the great, shape-shifting phantom queen of Celtic mythology – was the patron goddess of many things; variously death, war, revenge, fate, magic, prophecy, horses and the night all fell under her sphere of influence. She was said to have taken the form of the raven to fly over the battlefield, leading an army of undead soldiers, influencing the direction of the fight and deciding its outcome. The Morrigan had two other aspects, Nemain and Badb, who presided over the fury and venom of the combat respectively. Once the battle was over and the survivors had left the field, the Morrigan claimed her “acorn crop” – the heads of the slain as her trophies. Warriors aspired to bravery and heroism to gain the goddess’ favour and secure victory.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_khahyahlim_long	Judaism spread from the Levant to southern Arabia some time after AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Second Temple and brought the Great Jewish Revolt to an end. Deprived of their sovereign state, the Jews scattered, forming smaller diaspora as far away from Rome as possible. Some evidence exists of monotheist tendencies in Himyar around the 2nd century AD, but it was not until the reign of Dharamar Ayman, in AD375, that there was any explicit reference to Himyarite Judaism. The Himyarites had been a militaristic society for hundreds of years, and had constantly been at war with Kingdom of Aksum; their conversion was, in many ways, just another reason for their ceaseless conflict with the Christian Aksumites.	true

Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. By geographical location they were the first to come into contact with the marauding, murderous Huns. All steppe warriors were exceptional cavalry, highly skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that steppe women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women.	true

As skilled horsemen and infantry who excelled in light tactics, Thracians provided up to one third of the cavalry in the Macedonian army and a fifth of its infantry. In the Imperial age, Thracians were one of the largest auxiliary groups within the Roman army, contributing some 20,000 troops. As well as being famed for their prowess in battle, they also bore a reputation for joy in plunder and a vicious disregard for captives. 	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_light_cav	Most armies of the early Middle Ages continued to rely heavily on foot soldiers. This was due to the large number of low-status soldiers with little equipment of their own – certainly not horses – and little real training to speak of. In fact, cavalry-heavy forces were not generally part of the military fashion of the time until the development of the stirrup and the peaked saddle made them more attractive to the western powers. The stirrup increased the endurance, manoeuvrability and speed of the horse and reduced its rider's fatigue as the animal was easier to control; this, along with advances in armour technology, meant cavalry – now as heavy as the eastern cataphracts of antiquity - once again became a fixture on the battlefield.	true

A female-dominated society, supposedly descended from Ares, they were reputed to have lived on the shores of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus, the Amazons were killers of men and a popular source of artistic and poetic inspiration within Greek culture. When necessary, they intermingled with the all-male Gargareans to keep up their numbers, or enslaved the few men they needed after raids or battles. Depicted as superb archers, the Amazons are also often shown carrying spears, axes and crescent-shaped shields. Archaeology suggests Sarmatian and Scythian women participated in battle, which may be the source of the Amazons’ legend.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_ger_germanic_mounted_warband_long	The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of typical Germanic warriors, they were more suited to life as infantry. While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their cavalry expertise.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_royal_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true

In the summer, the members of the fianna – known as ‘fian’ – had to hunt for their own food, making additional income from selling the pelts of animals they had eaten. Fianna and their exploits are featured heavily in Irish folklore, particularly the Ulster Cycle - in which a band of twenty-seven fian are led by the druid Cathbad - and the Fenian Cycle – in which the mythical warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill leads them to victory against the enemies of the High King.	true

Originally occupying the land between the Caspian Sea and the northern shores of the Black Sea, many steppe peoples migrated westwards from the 6th century BC onwards. It’s not exactly clear why warriors from the steppes were considered the deadliest warriors of the age. Some suggest that their nomadic lifestyle prepared them for a time of global hardship and migration, whilst others think that the military tactics that emerged from their unique survival challenges were the perfect counter-balance to the received knowledge of the day.

Only the most seasoned of troops were chosen to join the Emperor's personal guard, in a ceremony that involved the wearing of his priceless purple robes. To be a 'domestici', whilst a prestigious position in itself, was seen as the path to further accolades; after several years service, the Emperor usually granted you command of a military regiment. As time went by, the role took on civil functions as well as military ones.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_al_rahrain_long	Very few easterners were professional soldiers and none, save for the noble-born cavalry, were formally trained or drilled. Instead, troops were levied by rich landowners as an obligation during times of war. For instance, levied infantry were typically untrained spearmen, with archers and slingers the more experienced and elite foot units. As might be expected due to the local terrain, cavalry was an important component in an eastern army, and several styles of horseback warfare emerged as a result. Horse archers were used to wear down infantry with fast, incessant attacks before and after thunder-strike cavalry charges from the fearsome heavy shock cavalry that was beginning to dominate the battlefield. Melee or spear infantry's main purpose was to pin the enemy down whilst the cavalry carried out complex its outflanking manoeuvres, which naturally affected the quality of troops employed for the role.	true

Hunnic warriors were some of the finest cavalry of the time, deadly-accurate with their composite bows but also capable of mounting ferocious charges armed with lances. Such was their reputation that many of their contemporaries thought them unrivalled in the saddle. Although, typically, the Romans considered them disorganised savages, the Huns actually used complex tactical manoeuvres in battle, including some particularly devastating feigned retreats. As they had no written language, or none that has yet been discovered, to uncover Hunnic societal customs we are forced to look at them through the oft-unfavourable eyes of their enemies. The Gothic writer Jordanes described them as a "savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech".	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_tribesmen	The Kingdom of Asturias was built atop the remnants of the Visigothic Kingdom, shattered by the Umayyad Caliphate's invasion during the first half of the 8th century AD. As such, many societal and military styles of earlier periods survived into the Asturian era. Aspects of old Iberian tribal culture were still alive and as a result Muslim forces encountered more difficulty capturing territory in the north. Its lack of modern, urban centres forced the fight out into the countryside - topography that the Asturians knew far better than the invaders and used to their advantage. In fact, the fledgling kingdom - founded by the Visigothic noble Pelagius - united the many displaced Christians against the Muslim threat. It was largely populated with Gothic refugees from the Umayyad conquest, who had refused to convert to Islam and submit to the caliphate's rule. As such, whilst Christian knights and soldiers became commonplace, tribal warriors remained an integral part of the Asturian military model, leading the kingdom to its first victory at the Battle of Covadonga in AD711.	true

It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_ambushers	Due to its sound logical reasoning, the ambush remains one of the most ancient and enduring military tactics. Essentially, a surprised enemy, and one who is hopefully surrounded at the time, can be defeated more swiftly and easily. Learned on the hunt, the skills needed to successfully ambush were first tested by early man against the beasts he hunted for food. Some of the most famous ambushes of history demonstrate the form's devastating potential, such as Hannibal's surprise attack on Roman forces at the River Trebia in 218BC and Arminius' resounding victory at the Teutoburg Forest, where his men descended from the forests to cut a Roman Legion to pieces. For the wise military commander, any forest or mountain pass presented an opportunity to lay an ambush or, if not scouted and traversed with sufficient care, to be ambushed.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_celtic_spears_long	While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by the Romans. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_catafractarii_long	Having faced the deadly Parthian cataphracts at Carrhae, come off worse, and then struggled against the awesome crushing strength of the Sarmatian lancers, it wasn't long before the Roman army was tailoring its own cavalry to match, despite resisting the idea for some time. Gradually, Rome began to integrate its own versions, the catafractarii and clibinarii, into the Legions. They were probably first fielded during the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, as an auxiliary force of Gauls and Pannonians. However, despite their general success, it was the 4th century AD before catafractarii became a permanent addition to the ranks, possibly due to Macrinus' catastrophic defeat at Nisibis in AD217, by the Parthians. Covered head-to-foot in scale or mail armour, and armed with lances, it is clear that the 'iron horsemen' were the forerunners to the more familiar knights of the Medieval age.	true

After subjugation by Alexander, Sogdians became traders, cementing themselves far along the Silk Road. In approximately AD260, the Sogdian central city, Samarkand, was conquered by the Sassanid Empire, following which it became a major religious centre, spreading Manichaeism into Asia. Sogdia's independent military power was forever dismantled but the Sassanids held on to Sogdia until the mid-4th century, when the nomadic confederation of Hephtalites seized the region.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_anti_cav_light_tier_4_long	There was no more important element in nomadic armies than the horse. Indeed, it was crucial not only to their strength in battle but also to their survival as a culture. The Sarmatians and Alani kept up to four horses per man, so that each day a fresh horse could be used. The horses they bred, and the men who rode them, were strong and determined, and used their numbers to overwhelm the enemy. Although nomads were known for their skill at horse archery, the Sarmatians and Alans in particular were fond of heavy shock tactics; running down their enemies with sword or lance before they could organise their defence. The nomads' sheer ferocity in battle meant that not only were they a terror to enemy foot soldiers, but contemporary heavy cavalrymen also.	true

Vikings were not just raiders, however, they also created a thriving trading economy, facilitated by their excellent shipbuilding and sailing skills. Their characteristic ‘longships’ enabled them to extend their reach as far afield as Russia, Ireland, and even Greenland. There is also evidence that later in the Dark Ages Viking explorers discovered America, several centuries before Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain. On the battlefield, Vikings generally used the traditional barbarian charge as part of their raiding tactics – striking hard and fast before melting away again as quickly as they appeared.	true

Therefore, in the name of variety, eastern cavalry took many forms. As a result short swordsmen, light skirmishers and archers were all used, but the primary, most effective weapon was the lance, particularly amongst the cataphract elite. The kontos was a wooden lance, roughly four metres in length, and was much stronger than contemporary Roman and Hellenistic lances. According to Plutarch, the strength of the lance and the power the rider put behind it meant that, purportedly, it could even skewer two men at once.	true

Often depicted with a spear-point and accompanied by an ibex, his sacred animal, Athtar was a god of war ("He Who is Bold in Battle") and the bringer of water and, in the more arid Arabian regions, the god of thunderstorms. In Canaanite legends, Athtar ascended to the throne of the late Ba'al Hadad to rule the world in his stead. Unfortunately, he soon proved himself unsuitable to rule - mainly as he was too small for Ba'al's throne - and was forced to return to the underworld. Temples to Athtar usually contained an open area with a fire in the centre, sharing the Zoroastrian concept of "holy fire". The kings of Saba even practised a rite knows as "Hunting the Game of Athtar and the Game of Kurum" (Kurum being a consort of Athtar) in order to make it rain.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_cel_onager_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_domestici	In any hierarchical society, the protection of the leader - be they emperor or king - is of utmost importance. Only the most seasoned troops were chosen to join the ruler's personal guard. Originally, the Romans conferred this title in a ceremony that involved wearing the Emperor's priceless purple robes. To be a 'domestici' was a prestigious position and the path to further accolades; from here it was possible to eventually lead your own military regiment. The works of Ammianus Marcellinus, who served as a domestici in the Roman Empire, are extensive sources from late antiquity; he chronicled much of Roman history from AD96 until the time of Constantine the Great.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_horsemen	Cavalry was far-less prominent amongst Anglo-Saxon forces than in other nations of the early Middle Ages. Their ancestors, the forest-dwelling Germanic tribes of the continent, famously had access to very few horses compared to their Roman or steppe nomad opponents and, other than references to pack animals pulling transport goods and supplies and messengers, little evidence of their military use has been found. However, in later centuries, there appears to have been a determined attempt by successive Saxon kings to breed a stock of hardy warhorses. The Anglo-Saxon thegns were usually seen atop horses, although rarely did they ride during battle due to the long-held "barbarian" tradition of fighting on foot and in melee as the preferred, most honourable method of combat. The Church, furthermore, was heavily involved in the raising of royal cavalry during later centuries – a prime example being in AD875, when the Worcester diocese was made responsible for the breeding and care of horses for the Mercian king, Ceowulf.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_wh_xionite_spears_long	The Xionites were some of the most famous warriors of the Hepthalite confederation, and may well have been the group who eventually became its ruling elite. Though their early history is shrouded in mystery, their settlements reveal them to be a nomadic people who spoke an eastern Iranian language, with deers featuring heavily in their iconography, indicating that the beasts were revered or worshipped. Eventually, the movement of other tribes drove the Xionites out of their Bactrian homelands and into the western part of central Asia – by this point under the auspices of the White Huns’ empire. As nomadic people, they relied heavily on horses in all aspects of their lives, being experts at riding and even slaying them – after which almost every part of the corpse had a practical use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_tanukhid_ambushers_long	The desert is a harsh and unforgiving place, yet it is home to many all the same. The people who lived there travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_redoubtable_chieftain_long	Scale armour arguably provides greater defence against than the standard chainmail that came to dominate late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Overlapping armour plates of metal, leather or horn - in varying shapes (but usually squares or fish scales) - were attached to one another and then sewn to an undershirt of cloth or leather in rows. Scales were used extensively by nomadic warriors such as the Scythians and Sarmatians, and eventually by the Romans too. They used scale mail - or 'lorica squamata' - from the days of the Roman Republic, although it was eventually superseded by the more famous 'lorica segmentata' commonly worn by Legionaries of the post-Marian period. Scale armour was also used far from Europe, where Japanese samurai warriors wore 'kozane' - literally 'fish scales' - from the 11th century AD onwards, before the advent of plate armour (which could stop bullets) relegated it to a ceremonial capacity only.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_est_persian_camel_raiders_long	Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly, and are generally less nervous. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. Also, when faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to back away from fights. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made controlling them considerably easier and conveyed another advantage; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick off targets with some ease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_mus_andalusian_marines	In the past, naval warfare was just another way for infantry to fight one another. The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the early Middle Ages, the Frankish navy was of no real distinction, yet Charlemagne did maintain a sizeable navy to defend against Viking raids, which was something other kingdoms generally failed to do. At the time, the distinction between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_raider_cav	The word 'jinete' translates as 'horseman', although sometimes refers to both horse and rider. Generally deployed in a light cavalry capacity, they were first deployed by Berber tribes such as the Zenata. Switching from camels to horseback, they noticed a sharp increase in the speed and agility they could bring to bear, making them much more manoeuvrable and therefore effective on the battlefield. After facing them in battle and coming off worse, the native Spanish Christians adopted the jinete model, modifying their equipment with swords, shields and javelins to better combat Islamic forces in the region. As the Reconquista gained momentum, more and more jinetes were fielded to face the aggressor, eventually becoming synonymous with Spain instead of the Berbers. Their tactics have been described thus "to swarm around the enemy, to overwhelm him with darts, to draw off if he charged in mass, but to hang upon his flanks and charge him when he grew tired, or fell into disorder".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_exploratores_long	As their name suggests ‘exploratores’ were fast-moving, mounted scouts, tasked with picking up trails, identifying potential ambush points and seeking vantage for the main forces of the Roman army. Often based in foreign climes, they proved extremely useful on campaign, selecting and safeguarding routes along which the Legions could advance, as well as patrolling distant frontiers and keeping a watchful eye on the many troublesome barbarian tribes. Exploratores’ battlefield role occasionally overlapped with that of the ‘speculatores’. Both specialist troop categories aided Rome’s generals by gathering vital military intelligence. Although speculatores achieved this chiefly through undercover operations, exploratores were primarily battlefield scouts who excelled in reconnaissance. Both units were highly regarded within the Roman army. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_royal_anstrutiones_long	The Franks were originally a group of Germanic tribes, formed along the Rhine frontier, who, in the 3rd century AD, migrated westwards to settle in Gaul and as far south as northern Hispania. Although technically a barbarian incursion which they at first resisted, Rome eventually recognised the new Frankish kingdom in around AD357. In return, many Franks fought alongside the Roman army as foederati after that date. Observing the Franks, the Roman historian Sidonius Apollinaris spoke of a love of fighting bred into their young from an early age, stating "it is their sport to send axes hurling through the vast void and know beforehand where the blow will fall, to whirl their shields, to outstrip with leaps and bounds the spears they have hurled, and reach the enemy first".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_sax_axe_band	Although the vast majority of Germanic warriors fought with spears - even as the Middle Ages dawned - the axe became more and more prevalent due to its effectiveness in penetrating the heavier types of armour of the period. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, could be used to pull aside or split shields, and were effective against plate or chainmail armour as, even if it didn't find the optimum angle to split it, a blow could still shatter bones and crush the organs beneath. One-handed axes may have been the most practical to carry and use, but two-handed axes were also common - the bearer requiring great upper-body strength to pick the weapon up and swing it repeatedly in combat.	true

It was capable of clinging fast to any material and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Greek fire was able to burn both on and under water, making it a highly-effective naval weapon, but one which could easily get out of control and destroy its users.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_elite_ostrogothic_pikemen	Originally migrating from the Baltic coast, the Goths settled in the Black Sea area but fragmented once their population outgrew the capacity of the region's natural resources. Following the departure of the Tervingi to the west, the Greuthungi continued to live in the area until pressure from Hunnic incursions, around AD370, caused a large part of the remaining population to migrate south into the Balkans and, crucially, Roman territory. Those left behind eventually became clients of the Huns, alternately rebelling and fighting for them in the west, notably at Chalons in AD451. Following the collapse of the Hunnic powerbase mid-way through the 5th century AD, with the Roman Empire in the west soon to follow, the surviving Greuthungi moved down into the Balkans, becoming known as the 'Ostrogoths' - literally 'Goths of the Rising Sun' or 'Eastern Goths'.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_badyia_skirmishers_long	The javelin is among the oldest weapons in the world. Equipped with javelins and little else, skirmishers harried both their opposite numbers and more tightly-packed melee infantry, peppering them before quickly retreating. This was the typical tactic of all unarmoured, javelin-armed troops of the age: to appear as if from nowhere, rain fire down on the enemy, and then retreat back into the terrain. Such harassment could be highly effective, particularly on the vast plains of the desert kingdoms, where a mobile, almost guerrilla style of warfare worked better than the regimented Roman battle lines that had conquered the west. The desert peoples saw war as a way of life - historical sources have very little information about their large scale battles, but often mention them as raiders in search of loot. In lightning fast raids, skirmish tactics using the javelin, alongside heavy cavalry, would have been vital to achieving a swift victory.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_slav_raiders	Although mounted troops are terrifying and effective as shock cavalry, charging down enemy lines and wreaking havoc, they also performed another, equally important function on the battlefields of the early Middle Ages. Lightly armoured and carrying spears or bows, a unit of fast riding, nimble horses were excellent raiding and skirmishing forces. Acting as a screen force for their main host, mounted skirmishers could flank and outmanoeuvre the enemy, peppering them with arrow or javelin fire before falling back out of range, sowing chaos and disorder amongst their ranks. More nimble melee cavalry struck the weak points in formations, delivering devastating attacks against lightly-armed and armoured missile troops, then retreating before the enemy could effectively counter-attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_avar_lancers	Developed from the cavalry skills of their ancestors, lancers were a type of heavy cavalry. Those of the nomadic steppe tribes wore scale armour to protect themselves and their mounts, and used a long lance known as a kontos, which enabled them to deliver devastating charges in a fashion comparable to the deadly cataphract cavalry from the east. Their scale armour was made from horn, or later metal, and allowed its wearers to easily run down their western counterparts. However, lancers were still vulnerable to dense pike or spear-armed formations. Archery provided a solution: sustained volleys from skirmishing foot and horse archers were used to thin and spread out the enemy prior to a devastating, thunderous charge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_eng_royal_companions	As retainers of the Anglo-Saxon king, 'thegns' were de-facto noblemen, though in reality they ranked between freemen and those of actual noble blood. These men were, and had always been, warriors, rallying to their king's side during wartime to command the army. Some thegns became more powerful still, being directly involved with the running of the Saxon state in addition to their military duties. Despite this, thegns still formed the backbone of Anglo-Saxon armies and as such were better trained and equipped than the common, levied fyrd. In the past, their equivalent - the 'gesith' - were the tribal leader's personal companions, his stalwart retainers, champions, and defenders on the battlefield. Eventually, following the emergence of the European kingdoms during the Dark Ages, their services were rewarded with lands and titles as a precursor to the concept of fealty and vassalage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_byz_armoured_archers	In battle, the archer needed to be peerless. His aim had to be unfailingly precise or else he was next to useless - a mere distraction for a determined enemy force. Arrows had great power and impact but, before the development of the bodkin-point arrowhead, if they were aimed even slightly off target, they would bounce off armour rather than pierce it. The bodkin-point was thinner than its broadhead-point counterpart, and was therefore better at piercing mail and some plate armours due to its smaller surface area. Bodkin-pointed arrowheads were used mainly by the Viking Danes but caught on across Europe. However, they didn't eclipse the more common broadhead-point, which were generally better at cutting through flesh and causing serious, mortal wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_des_es_zealot_sicarius_long	Sicarii is Latin, meaning "dagger-wielders", and the men who held the title lived up to that name. Murderers and assassins, the Sicarii were Jewish freedom fighters dedicated to the liberation of their people from the Roman yoke, declaring that "only God should rule the Jews". The assassins worked in the shadows with other revolutionary groups, such as the Zealots, to sow chaos and disorder throughout the province. Pragmatic in their cruelty, the Sicarii killed many of their own people too - those who collaborated, those who sympathised with their enemies, and defeatists who advocated surrender.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_vik_berserkers	Howling like animals and biting their shields, berserkers took on the appearance of wild animals, entering battle in an almost trance-like state. Worked into a rage before combat, possibly through the use of drugs, they had little protection but were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade and indeed any blow that came their way. At the time, berserkers were thought to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria. However, their intended victims did not have the luxury of considering the opponent that stood before them; berserkers fought with a reckless fury, making them very uncompromising opponents to face, and to slay a berserker was thought a most impressive act of courage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_francisca_heerbann_long	Amongst the Franks the term 'heerbann' was used to describe freemen called to bear arms for their country on a contractual basis, rather like the Anglo-Saxon 'fyrd' who came after them. Months prior to embarking on a military campaign the Franks mustered a heerbann, allowing time for them to equip, assemble and train for the conflict ahead. Ignoring a call to join could lead to harsh penalties, although heeding it also had its downsides, as many minor landowners struggled to afford their own armour and weapons. Although changed by the advent of the feudal system, the custom of calling a heerbann remained in place until around the time of the Crusades, gradually evolving into the Medieval French word 'arriere-ban'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_steppe_horse_archers_long	The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians and Huns, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_dro_light_mis_sco_van	The dromonarion was smaller and lighter than the dromon and was ideal for patrolling the mouths of rivers. Following the Battle of Actium, where Augustus defeated Marc Anthony and Cleopatra to become First Citizen and de facto Emperor, the Roman navy favoured lighter, more manoeuvrable ships over the larger warships used by the Greeks. This was because of the types of duties they were expected to perform; tasks such as escorting the grain ships from Egypt, suppression of piracy, and river patrols. By this time, large ships were no longer required as there were few naval powers who remained large enough to pose a threat to the new Roman Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_est_persian_mounted_bowmen_long	Born from a tradition of raiding nomadic tribesmen, mounted archery became firmly established in the ancient world, leading to some highly effective battlefield units. While foot archers could be equipped with longer, more powerful bows, the mounted archer was still a formidable opponent thanks to the design of the composite bow. Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden variety. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina to use well, the composite bow demanded respect, care and attention. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_sarmatian_cataphracts_long	The Sarmatians, a western group of steppe peoples, occupied the area north of the Black Sea, bordering Dacian and Germanic lands. They roamed this region as they pleased, and had a fierce reputation as cavalrymen almost without equal. They were feared by the Greeks, and often worked as mercenaries or allied themselves to the Dacians. The Sarmatians were always horse archers, but their cavalry gradually adopted heavier and heavier armour as the centuries passed, eventually wearing as much armour as the famed cataphracts of the east. Even the horses wore full suits of scale armour. The riders kept their fearsome bows, even as they became magnificent shock cavalry. With each man carrying a kontos, a long two-handed lance, they could smash through almost any enemy foolish enough to stand against them. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_saxon_lancers_long	Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by the Roman Empire’s successors - the Byzantines in the east and the Germanic peoples in the west.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nor_saxon_spears_long	Arguably the first time the 'Saxones' - an aggressive Germanic tribe - was mentioned was by the Egyptian writer Claudius Ptolemy in 'Geographia', during the 2nd century AD. At the time they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the 'Saxones' again, in AD356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier due to alarmingly-frequent Saxon raids led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Following the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century, several branches of Saxons, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated to the former Roman province of Britannia. Over the ensuing years, they settled there in large numbers, eventually becoming known as the 'English' and the place, 'England'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_nom_uar_archers_long	The Uars, also known as the ‘White Huns,’ are thought to be part of the Hephthalites, a nomadic people. Their origins are still debated by historians, some arguing that they were of Iranian decent, while others suggesting that they were Turkic. Unlike the ‘Black Huns’ of the north, the Uars had fair complexions and their aristocracy bedecked themselves in fine clothes and jewellery. Their main stronghold, Tokharistan, was situated on the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush Mountains. By the 5th century AD the Uars had succeeded in expanding their territory as far south as India, although that situation was to be short lived. During the early 6th century AD, they were driven out by the Indian kings Yasodharman and Narasimhagupta.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_merc_rom_palatina_long	'Auxilia palatina' were elite auxiliary troops that first emerged from the military reforms and expansion of Constantine the Great in AD325. Drafted from the local populace, auxiliaries often took the name of the tribe from which they were predominantly comprised, such as the Mattiaci and the Ampsivarii. The Notitia Dignitatum gives a fairly comprehensive list of units classified as auxilia palatina but does not give any direct reference to the strength of those troops. However, there is some confusion between auxilia and limitanei, who were specifically frontier troops. It can be assumed, therefore, that auxilia palatina were stationed in force behind the Empire's frontiers, in such places as Gaul, Iberia and Britannia.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_alan_anti_cav_light_tier_3_long	There was no more important element in nomadic armies than the horse. Indeed, it was crucial not only to their strength in battle but also to their survival as a culture. The Sarmatians and Alani kept up to four horses per man, so that each day a fresh horse could be used. The horses they bred, and the men who rode them, were strong and determined, and used their numbers to overwhelm the enemy. Although nomads were known for their skill at horse archery, the Sarmatians and Alans in particular were fond of heavy shock tactics; running down their enemies with sword or lance before they could organise their defence. The nomads' sheer ferocity in battle meant that not only were they a terror to enemy foot soldiers, but contemporary heavy cavalrymen also.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_royal_archers_long	As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. They thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war; warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_ger_alani_general_long	The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. By the end of the 4th century AD, when the Huns stormed down from the steppes, the Alans were living beyond the River Don, northeast of the Black Sea. The Huns' arrival drove them from the region in several groups, some of whom joined the emergent Vandals as they migrated into Roman-held Gaul, becoming part of their confederation from that point onwards.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_cel_kings_warband_long	In Celtic Ireland, ‘fianna’ were independent bands of men and women, often aristocratic but yet to inherit, who proved their mettle in service of a local lord. As such, they were supplied with food and shelter during the winter months in return for keeping the peace. In the summer, the members of the fianna – known as ‘fian’ – had to hunt for their own food, making additional income from selling the pelts of animals they had eaten. Fianna and their exploits are featured heavily in Irish folklore, particularly the Ulster Cycle - in which a band of twenty-seven fian are led by the druid Cathbad - and the Fenian Cycle – in which the mythical warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill leads them to victory against the enemies of the High King.	true

Skirmishers were usually the poor - freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_bel_ost_sagittarii	'Sagittarii' were archers, drawn from Roman subject peoples to augment the Legions. As the centuries wore on, following several sets of reforms, almost all were folded into the Roman army proper and, as Rome came to rely more on barbarian foederati, they became part of its tribal military wing also. In the West, archers were used in much smaller numbers than other skirmisher classes. Possibly this is due to the composite bows with which they fought; the glue used tended to dissolve in wet western climes and the wood would warp, rendering the weapons entirely useless. It was a much more common sight for units of sagittarii to be attached to Eastern armies as cavalry, where they followed their region's ancient traditions of skirmishing from horseback.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_lib_light_spike_ram_slav_long	The 'sagena' - meaning 'arrow' - and its smaller cousin the 'kondura' were the vessels of choice of the Narentine pirates, Slavic pagans who switched fishing for piracy and the slave trade during the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Probably based on the Nordic drakkar, these ships were long, slender and shallow, which made them considerably faster than the opposition. The sagena could carry up to forty warriors and the kondura half that number. The ability to outrun the Byzantine Roman authorities, coupled with their capture of Papal emissaries on their way to Constantinople in AD870, intimidated them to the point where Emperor Constantine VII ordered a large amount for use in his own fleets. The most famous example to be discovered is the so-called 'Condura Croatica', found buried in the town of Nin in 1966, and dated to the 14th century - indicating that the kondura and sagena were hardy and effective enough to remain in production for many centuries.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_att_rom_onager_large_long	One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege machine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise on ‘Mechanics’, the onager made use of a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted, twisted, and propelled rocks or shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_fra_horsemen	Like other former barbarian kingdoms, the Franks inherited much of the Roman Empire's military and societal structure, not just its territory. Once again, cavalry was an aristocratic division as only wealthy landowners could afford horses and therefore provide cavalry during times of war. Elite cavalry, by extension, was drawn only from the most highly-skilled among them. They, more than any other, could afford not only the horse, but the mail and plate armour required; 'brunia' body armour was the single most expensive piece of military equipment of the age, costing more than the horse itself. Some took this to excess, adorning their armour with jewels and other finery, but Charlemagne was known to have criticised his noblemen for such ostentatious displays. In battle, Carolingian cavalry favoured a mass charge of spears to break the enemy quickly. This worked particularly well on favourable, flat terrain but led to problems on less-than-ideal topography. In fact, cavalry was still considered inferior until long after the Battle of Tours when, due to a failure in mobilisation, Charles Martel won the battle without any heavy horse at all. Standard Frankish horsemen were lightly armoured (wearing little more than padded cloth), carried spears and shields, and were best-suited for bringing home a cavalry charge and then, once involved in the fray, remaining to press the attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_spa_royal_cav	The mounted knights of the Middle Ages have their origins in the 'ordo equester' cohorts of the Roman state cavalry, as well as the privately-funded household cavalry ('bucellarii') of late-period Rome. Being privately funded, the bucellarii were afforded better armour and training than other equestrians, and this focus on training, armour and weaponry was the basis of the emerging knight's skillset. The cataphract horsemen of the east, donned in armour that covered both rider and his powerful steed, were also an influence. In Europe, the Franks bred the 'Barb' horse, a sturdy and hot-blooded north African breed (the name meaning 'Berber') capable of coping with both heavy armour and the punishing demands of warfare. These horses were the tools that allowed Charlemagne's strategy to be realised across Europe. The horsemen, for their efforts, were rewarded with lands and titles. In the centuries following Charlemagne's rule, these men and their descendants went on to solidify their power, evolving into an elite warrior class by the beginning of the Medieval period.	true
